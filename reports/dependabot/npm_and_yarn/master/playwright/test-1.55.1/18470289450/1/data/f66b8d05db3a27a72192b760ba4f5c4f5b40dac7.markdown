                - paragraph [ref=e267]: A Cluster Profile is a declarative model of a Kubernetes infrastructure stack. A Kubernetes infrastructure stack is broken into multiple layers, from core layers like base Operating System (OS), Kubernetes, storage, network, to additional add-on layers such as load balancer, ingress controller, logging, monitoring, security, etc. For each layer, Palette provides multiple out-of-the-box options and versions. The cluster profile is essentially a configuration of end-to-end Kubernetes stacks and settings that you create based on your needs, which you can reuse every time you need to deploy a cluster matching that configuration. For example, let us say for AI/ML you need a cluster with a base OS with an NVIDIA driver installed and Kubeflow installed in the cluster, but for a production cluster, you need a different stack with Logging (EFK), Monitoring (Prometheus), Security (Twistlock) pre-installed.

After that, the target cluster self-manages the cluster and application lifecycle. All Day-2 operations which result in node changes, including OS/Kubernetes upgrades, scaling, and nodes certificate rotation, are triggered by changes to the Cluster API resources in the target workload cluster.

This Kubernetes version can be deployed through Palette to all major infrastructure providers, public cloud providers, and private data center providers. This is the default distribution when deploying a Kubernetes cluster through Palette. You have the option to choose other Kubernetes distributions, such as MicroK8s, Konvoy, and more, should you want to consume a different Kubernetes distribution.
                - paragraph [ref=e337]: PXK is different from the upstream open source Kubernetes version primarily because of the carefully reviewed and applied hardening of the operating system (OS) and Kubernetes. The hardening ranges from removing unused kernel modules to using an OS configuration that follows industry best practices. Our recompiled Kubernetes configuration addresses common Kubernetes deployment security pitfalls and implements industry best practices.
                - paragraph [ref=e338]: A benefit of Palette when used with PXK is the ability to apply different flavors of container storage interface (CSI) plugins and container network interface (CNI) plugins. Other open source Kubernetes distributions, such as MicroK8s, RKE2, and K3s, come with a default CSI and CNI. Additional complexity and overhead are required from you to enable different interfaces. PXK supports the ability to select other interface plugins out of the box without any additional overhead or complexity needed from your side.

                - paragraph [ref=e346]: With PXK-E, you can manage automatic OS upgrades while retaining immutability and the flexibility to roll out changes safely. The A/B partition architecture of Kairos allows for new OS and dependency versions to be installed in a separate partition and mounted at runtime. You can fall back to use the previous partition if issues are identified in the new partition.
                - paragraph [ref=e347]: PXK-E manages the underlying OS and the Kubernetes layer together, which reduces the challenge of upgrading and maintaining two separate components.
                - paragraph [ref=e348]: PXK-E allows you to apply different flavors of container storage interfaces (CSI) and container network interfaces (CNI). Other open source Kubernetes distributions such as MicroK8s, RKE2, and K3s come with a default CSI and CNI.

                - paragraph [ref=e445]: The multi-cluster management and governance capabilities are supervised with Palette Workspaces. Workspaces enable the logical grouping of clusters and namespaces to provide application or team-specific governance and visibility into workloads, cost, and usage metrics. For example, the application or team workload may be deployed into namespaces across clusters for achieving High Availability (HA), Disaster Recovery (DR), organization-specific placement policies, etc. Grouping the namespaces and clusters into a workspace provide central management and governance in a multi-cluster distributed environment.
