Here, you will find tutorials covering the aspects of Palette you need to become a proficient user, as well as advanced topics that require more time and attention to comprehend. These tutorials will enable you to maximize Palette's ability to manage Kubernetes at scale.
- [Downloads](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/downloads/): Explore our downloads section to discover the latest and specific versions of support tools and utilities for Palette.
- [Artifact Studio](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/downloads/artifact-studio/): The Spectro Cloud [Artifact Studio](https://artifact-studio.spectrocloud.com/) is a unified platform that helps airgapped, regulatory-focused, and security-conscious organizations populate their registries with bundles, packs, and installers to be used with self-hosted [Palette](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/enterprise-version/) or [Palette VerteX](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/vertex/). It provides a single location for packs and images, streamlining access and management.
- [Cluster Profiles](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/profiles/cluster-profiles/): Cluster profiles are composed of layers using packs, Helm charts, and custom manifests to meet specific types of workloads on your Palette cluster deployments. You can create as many profiles as needed for your workload cluster deployments.
- [Self-Hosted Palette](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/enterprise-version/): Palette is available as a self-hosted platform offering. You can install the self-hosted version of Palette on your data center, public cloud providers, or Edge devices to manage Kubernetes clusters.
- [Deployment Architecture Overview](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/architecture/architecture-overview/): Palette is available in three flexible deployment models: multi-tenant SaaS, dedicated SaaS, and self-hosted.
- [Deployment Modes](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/deployment-modes/): Palette provides two different modes for deploying and managing applications. The first mode is Cluster Mode; this mode enables you to create, deploy, and manage Kubernetes clusters and applications. The second mode is App Mode, a mode optimized for a simpler and streamlined developer experience that allows you to only focus on the building, maintenance, testing, deployment, and monitoring of your applications.
- [Palette VerteX](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/vertex/): Palette VerteX offers regulated industries, such as government and public sector organizations that handle sensitive and classified information, simplicity, security, and scale in production Kubernetes. VerteX is available as a self-hosted platform offering that you can install on your data centers, public cloud providers, or Edge devices to manage Kubernetes clusters.
- [Virtual Machine Orchestrator](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/vm-management/): Palette Virtual Machine Orchestrator (VMO) provides a unified platform for deploying, managing, and scaling Virtual Machines (VMs) and containerized applications within Kubernetes clusters. Palette VMO supports deployment to edge devices and bare metal servers in data centers. Palette VMO simplifies infrastructure management, improves resource utilization, and eliminates hypervisor costs.
- [Edge](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/clusters/edge/): Edge clusters are Kubernetes clusters set up on Edge hosts installed in isolated locations like grocery stores and restaurants versus a data center or cloud environment. These Edge hosts can be bare metal machines or virtual machines and are managed by operators at remote sites.
- [Palette Virtual Clusters](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/clusters/palette-virtual-clusters/): Palette Virtual Clusters are nested Kubernetes clusters within a host cluster. Virtual clusters share the host cluster resources, such as CPU, memory, storage, container network interface (CNI), and container storage interface (CSI). By default, virtual clusters use k3s, a highly available, certified Kubernetes distribution designed for production workloads. Virtual clusters are supported in both connected and airgapped environments.
- [Public Cloud Clusters](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/clusters/public-cloud/) : Palette supports provisioning new workload clusters on public clouds using cloud providers' infrastructure. It achieves this by provisioning new VMs for the control plane and worker pools and uses their managed Kubernetes services such as EKS, AKS, GKE, and more.
- [Data Center Clusters](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/clusters/data-center/): Palette supports the provisioning and end-to-end lifecycle management of Kubernetes workload clusters on various private clouds, bare metal servers, and in self-hosted environments.
- [Palette Dev Engine](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/devx/): Palette provides two different modes for deploying and managing applications. The first mode is Cluster Mode - this mode enables you to create, deploy, and manage Kubernetes clusters and applications. The second mode is App Mode - a mode optimized for a simpler and streamlined developer experience that allows you to only focus on the building, maintenance, testing, deployment, and monitoring of your applications.
- [Palette CLI](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/automation/palette-cli/): The Palette CLI contains various functionalities that you can use to interact with Palette and manage resources. The Palette CLI is well suited for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines and recommended for automation tasks, where Terraform or direct API queries are not ideal.
- [Palette Go SDK](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/automation/palette-sdk/): The [Palette Go Software Developer Toolkit (SDK)](https://github.com/spectrocloud/palette-sdk-go) provides Go developers a user-friendly client for interacting with Palette APIs.
- [Terraform](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/automation/terraform/): Palette and Palette VerteX APIs can be used with the Spectro Cloud Terraform provider. The provider is available in the HashiCorp Terraform registry and offers detailed [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs) on supported data sources and resources.
- [Crossplane](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/automation/crossplane/): Palette supports the open source Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) project Crossplane. Crossplane transforms Kubernetes clusters into universal control planes, extending the Kubernetes API and enabling infrastructure resource provisioning and management across major infrastructure providers.
- [Certification of Compliance](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/legal-licenses/compliance/): Palette VerteX is FIPS 140-3, SOC 2 Type II, and ISO 27001:2022 certified.
