In Palette, the _tenant admin_ role can access tenant settings. This role is the equivalent of a system administrator.
As a tenant admin, you can configure Palette and its features to behave in a manner that best fits your organization and
its users.

To learn more about the permissions and privileges available to the tenant role, refer to the

## Projects

A **Project** helps you organize the clusters and cluster resources in a logical grouping. The resources that are
created within a project are scoped to that project and not available to other projects. You can also assign users and
teams with specific roles to specific projects. Check out the [Projects](./projects/projects.md) page to learn more.

Use the following resources to become familiar with the available tenant settings and how to change the tenant settings.
