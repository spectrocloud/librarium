You can add a registry at the tenant level, or if you are using self-hosted Palette or Palette VerteX, you can add registries at the system level. Registries added at the system level are available to all the tenants. Registries added at the tenant level are available only to that tenant. This section describes how to add a tenant-level registry. For guidance on adding a registry at the system scope, check out [Add System-Level Registry](../enterprise-version/system-management/add-registry.md). 


To add a tenant-level registry, you must have tenant admin access to Palette. Use the following resources to learn more about the different types of registries that you can add to Palette:

- [OCI Registries](../registries-and-packs/registries/oci-registry/oci-registry.md)

- [Helm Registries](../registries-and-packs/registries/helm-charts.md)

- [Legacy Pack Registries](../registries-and-packs/registries/pack-registries.md)


To add a system level registry, you must have system admin access to a self-hosted Palette or Palette VerteX environment. Check out the [Self-Hosted Add Registry](../enterprise-version/system-management/add-registry.md) guide or the [VerteX Add Registry](../vertex/system-management/add-registry.md) guide.
