## Delete a Project

You can remove projects by using the following steps.

### Prerequisites

- Tenant admin access.

- No active clusters in the project.

:::warning

You can delete projects with force as long as there are no active clusters. Force deleting will eliminate all resources
linked to the project, such as app profiles, cluster profiles, workspaces, audit logs, and custom project settings.
However, if a project has active clusters, you must remove them first before deleting the project.
