## May 25, 2025 - Release 4.6.X {#release-notes-4.6.c}

### Security Notices

- Review the [Security Bulletins](../security-bulletins/reports/reports.mdx) page for the latest security advisories.

### Palette Enterprise {#palette-enterprise-4.6.c}

#### Breaking Changes {#breaking-changes-4.6.c}

:::warning

Due to updates to Cluster API (CAPI) in this release, we recommend that you enable the
[Pause Agent Upgrades](../clusters/cluster-management/platform-settings/pause-platform-upgrades.md) feature on any
impacted clusters until you've handled the below mentioned breaking changes and are ready for cluster repaves.

:::

- Due to a new behavior introduced with Cluster API (CAPI) v1.9.4, you must add the `cluster.x-k8s.io/drain: skip` label
  to any deployments with the `Node.spec.unschedulable` toleration set. If not added, this can lead to deployments stuck
  in a termination loop due to an unwanted
  [node drain](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/tasks/automated-machine-management/machine_deletions.html#node-drain).
  Use the following steps to help identify and apply the label to affected Deployments.

  1. Identify any Kubernetes Deployment manifests or Helm values that includes the following
     [tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/).

     ```yaml hideClipboard
     - key: node.kubernetes.io/unschedulable
       effect: NoSchedule
     - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/unschedulable
       operator: Exists
       effect: NoSchedule
     ```

  2. Patch each deployment to include the `cluster.x-k8s.io/drain: skip` label.

     ```yaml hideClipboard title="Example"
     metadata:
       labels:
         cluster.x-k8s.io/drain: skip
     ```

- Due to an upgrade of Cluster API Provider AWS (CAPA) to v2.7.1, Palette requires additional Amazon Web Services (AWS)
  permissions to operate and perform actions on your behalf. Refer to the
  [Required IAM Policies](../clusters/public-cloud/aws/required-iam-policies.md) reference page for a full list of core
  policies and minimum permissions.

- Due to an upgrade of Cluster API Provider GCP (CAPG) to
  [v1.8.1](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-gcp/releases/tag/v1.8.1), the following additional
  IAM permissions are now required for GCP cluster deployments:

  - `compute.disks.setLabels`
  - `compute.globalForwardingRules.setLabels`

  This is due to a fix in [v1.8.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-gcp/releases/tag/v1.8.0)
  where labels may be populated for persistent disks and global forwarding rules. Refer to the
  [Required IAM Permissions](../clusters/public-cloud/gcp/required-permissions.md#required-permissions) guide for all
  required GCP IAM permissions.

- After upgrading Palette to this release, Palette will automatically trigger a repave on existing GKE clusters for node
  pools. This is because the CAPG version has been updated from v1.2.1 to v1.8.1, which automatically adds a new
  ownership label `capg-<cluster-name>=owned`. As GKE treats a node pool label map as immutable, the label insertion
  triggers a rolling repave of all worker nodes.

#### Features

- You can now assign an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to a node pool when deploying Amazon EKS clusters. To do this, apply
  an additional label in the **Node Configuration Settings** during cluster creation. For guidance and a list of
  supported AMIs, refer to the
  [Assign an AMI to a Node Pool](../clusters/public-cloud/aws/eks.md#assign-an-ami-to-a-node-pool) section.

  - If you choose to assign an Amazon Linux 2023 AMI to your worker nodes and you are using PersistentVolumes (PVs) or
    PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs), you must make additional edits to your AWS EKS cluster profile to configure IAM Roles
    for Service Accounts (IRSA) for the Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) Container Storage Interface (CSI). Refer to the
    [prerequisites for creating EKS clusters](../clusters/public-cloud/aws/eks.md#prerequisites) for guidance.

- When deploying an Azure IaaS cluster through a [Self Hosted PCG](../clusters/pcg/deploy-pcg-k8s.md), you can now
  select a specific resource group and private DNS zone for your private API server load balancer. This allows you to
  reuse an existing private DNS zone for multiple private Azure IaaS clusters even when the zone is kept in a different
  resource group.

  Refer to the [Create and Manage Azure IaaS Cluster](../clusters/public-cloud/azure/create-azure-cluster.md) guide for
  more information.

- Starting with version 4.6.c, Palette and VerteX installations need to be activated after 30 days. Once you install or
  upgrade Palette or VerteX to version 4.6.c or later, you have 30 days to activate it. During this time, you have
  unrestricted access to all of Palette's features. After 30 days, you can continue to use Palette, and existing
  clusters will remain operational, but you cannot perform day-2 operations such as creating new clusters and modifying
  existing ones until Palette is activated.

  Refer to the [Activate Palette](../enterprise-version/activate-installation/activate-installation.md) and
  [Activate VerteX](../vertex/activate-installation/activate-installation.md) guides for further information.

#### Improvements

- CAPG has been upgraded to [v1.8.1](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-gcp/releases/tag/v1.8.1)
  from [v1.2.1](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-gcp/releases/tag/v1.2.1).

  As part of this release, newly created GKE clusters will have an additional default label applied to their node pools.
  This is due to a change starting from CAPG v1.3 where a cluster-ownership label is automatically injected into every
  node pool.

  The following table displays the default labels between the previous and current CAPG release.

  | CAPG Version | Default Labels on Node Pools                                                     |
  | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | v1.2.1       | `goog-gke-node-pool-provisioning-model: on-demand`                               |
  | v1.8.1       | `goog-gke-node-pool-provisioning-model: on-demand`, `capg-<cluster-name>: owned` |

  :::warning

  In GKE, a node poolâ€™s label set is an immutable field, and any changes to it will trigger a repave. As such, any GKE
  clusters built with an older release will be automatically repaved by Palette. This will occur after Palette has been
  upgraded to this release or later.

  :::

- The Palette UI allows users to specify an optional team description during team creation. This new field makes it
  possible for system administrators to provide a meaningful description to user teams. Refer to the
  [Create and Manage a Team](../user-management/users-and-teams/create-a-team.md) guide for further information.
- Palette [interface customization](../enterprise-version/system-management/customize-interface.md) has been expanded
  with the ability to hide the login panel image and Spectro Cloud sidebar logo, change the default documentation
  domain, and change the **Sign in to your tenant** logo.
- The management of
  [cluster profile variables](../profiles/cluster-profiles/create-cluster-profiles/define-profile-variables/define-profile-variables.md)
  has been improved in the Palette UI. Users can now review and modify variable values during
  [cluster profile version changes](../profiles/cluster-profiles/modify-cluster-profiles/version-cluster-profile.md).
- Velero has been upgraded to version 1.15, which is used internally by Palette for backing up and restoring clusters.
  Existing clusters with backups configured will be automatically updated to Velero version 1.15, ensuring continuous
  access to backup and restore functionality. Refer to the
  [Backup and Restore](../clusters/cluster-management/backup-restore/backup-restore.md) page to learn more about backup
  and restore tools in Palette.
- Palette now uses Cluster API Provider AWS (CAPA) version 2.7.1 internally. Refer to the
  [documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-aws/tree/v2.7.1) for further information.
- [Self-hosted Palette](../enterprise-version/enterprise-version.md) now supports anonymous SMTP mode, allowing users to
  authenticate without a username and password. We recommend using authenticated SMTP wherever possible. Refer to the
  [Configure SMTP](../enterprise-version/system-management/smtp.md) guide for further information.

### Edge

:::info

The [CanvOS](https://github.com/spectrocloud/CanvOS) version corresponding to the 4.6.c Palette release is 4.6.21.

:::

#### Features

- <TpBadge /> The new [Appliance Studio](../deployment-modes/appliance-mode/appliance-studio.md) is a lightweight
  Graphical User Interface (GUI) application that allows you to build, save, edit, and manage the two configuration
  files that are essential to the EdgeForge process, with zero risk of syntax errors.

  Refer to the [Prepare User Data and Argument Files](../clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/prepare-user-data.md) guide to
  learn more.

- <TpBadge /> The Palette Optimized Canonical Kubernetes distribution is now an available selection for the [EdgeForge
  workflow](../clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/edgeforge-workflow.md) of preparing an Edge host with all the required
  components and dependencies. Refer to the [Build Edge
  Artifacts](../clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/palette-canvos/palette-canvos.md) for further information.

#### Improvements

- Improved the upgrade process for the Palette agent and increased its reliability.
- Palette CLI now supports uploading one or more content bundles to the Edge host as long as the host has enough
  physical storage and you have allocated sufficient storage to your registry. Refer to the
  [Upload Content Bundle](../clusters/edge/local-ui/cluster-management/upload-content-bundle.md) guide for further
  information.
- [Local UI](../clusters/edge/local-ui/local-ui.md) has now exited Tech Preview and is ready for production workloads.
  Check out the [Access Local UI](../clusters/edge/local-ui/host-management/access-console.md) guide for further
  details.
- A troubleshooting script named `support-bundle-edge.sh` is now embedded on the Edge host. It can run on hosts without
  an internet connection, allowing you to debug common issues, such as Edge hosts failing to register, pod failures, or
  provisioning errors. Refer to the
  [Collect Support Bundles for Edge Cluster](../troubleshooting/edge/collect-support-bundles.md) troubleshooting
  reference page for further details.

#### Deprecations and Removals

- The `stylus.installationMode`
  [Edge Installer Configuration](../clusters/edge/edge-configuration/installer-reference.md) flag is deprecated. We
  recommend using the `stylus.managementMode` flag instead, which has two allowed values: `central`, which means the
  Edge host is connected to Palette, and `local`, which means the Edge host has no connection to a Palette instance.
  Refer to the [Prepare User Data](../clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/prepare-user-data.md) for further information.

### VerteX

#### Features

- Includes all Palette features, improvements, breaking changes, and deprecations in this release. Refer to the
  [Palette section](#palette-enterprise-4.6.c) for more details.

### Automation

:::info

Check out the [CLI Tools](../downloads/cli-tools.md) page to find the compatible version of the Palette CLI.

:::

#### Breaking Changes {#breaking-changes-automation-4.6.c}

- The Terraform resource `spectrocloud_macros` no longer supports the `project` field. Use the new `context` field to
  specify the project or tenant scope for your macro. Additionally, you must use the `project_name` provider
  configuration parameter to specify a project context. For more information, refer to the Spectro Cloud Terraform
  provider [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs).

#### Features

- The `content` command of the [Palette CLI](../automation/palette-cli/palette-cli.md) now has an `upload` subcommand.
  This subcommand allows you to upload a content bundle to a locally managed Edge host through Local UI. Once the upload
  is complete, you can provision clusters locally using the uploaded content when the host does not have a connection to
  a central Palette instance or an image repository.

  Refer to the [Upload Content Bundle](../clusters/edge/local-ui/cluster-management/upload-content-bundle.md) reference
  page for further information.

- The `spectrocloud_appliance` resource now supports [remote shell](../clusters/edge/cluster-management/remote-shell.md)
  activation, allowing you to troubleshoot Edge hosts by initiating an SSH connection from Palette. For more
  information, refer to the Spectro Cloud Terraform provider
  [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs).

#### Improvements

#### Deprecations and Removals

- The `tc` subcommand of the [Palette CLI](../automation/palette-cli/palette-cli.md) is deprecated. This command
  provided functionality for deploying target clusters using the Palette CLI. We recommend using the
  [Spectro Cloud Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs) for
  cluster deployment automation.
- The `spectrocloud_macro` Terraform resource is deprecated. We recommend using the `spectrocloud_macros` resource to
  create and manage service output variables and macros. For more information, refer to the Spectro Cloud Terraform
  provider [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs).

### Virtual Machine Orchestrator (VMO)

#### Improvements

- The [Virtual Machine Migration Assistant](../vm-management/vm-migration-assistant/vm-migration-assistant.md) is now
  supported for airgapped environments. Refer to the Additional Packs pages for
  [self-hosted Palette](../downloads/self-hosted-palette/additional-packs.md#additional-deployment-options) and
  [Palette VerteX](../downloads/palette-vertex/additional-packs.md#additional-deployment-options) for the relevant link
  to download this pack and upload instructions.

### Docs and Education

- We have added a new [Downloads](../downloads/downloads.md) tab to the top navigation bar of the Spectro Cloud
  Documentation site. This tab provides a centralized location for downloading all support tools and utilities for
  Palette.

### Packs

  associated with cloud accounts that have been created on older Palette versions.

## May 5, 2025 - Release 4.6.24

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue that caused [Edge hosts](../clusters/edge/edge.md) to reboot continuously after a cluster deletion and
  completed [reset](../clusters/edge/local-ui/host-management/reset-reboot.md#reset-edge-host).
- Fixed an issue where Kubernetes version upgrades initiated through [Local UI](../clusters/edge/local-ui/local-ui.md)
  failed for [Edge](../clusters/edge/edge.md) clusters containing the `harbor-edge-native-config` pack.
- Fixed an issue where
  [Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)](../clusters/cluster-management/compliance-scan.md#sbom-dependencies--vulnerabilities)
  scans failed to execute successfully for all clusters.
- Fixed an issue where POST API calls to `/v1/spectroclusters/edge-native` failed for U.S. multi-tenant SaaS

  included in the cluster profile.

### Improvements

- The default timeout for [remote shell](../clusters/edge/cluster-management/remote-shell.md) has been increased to 12
  hours of inactivity.

## April 19, 2025 - Release 4.6.23 {#release-notes-4.6.b}

### Security Notices

- Review the [Security Bulletins](../security-bulletins/reports/reports.mdx) page for the latest security advisories.

### Palette Enterprise {#palette-enterprise-4.6.b}

#### Breaking Changes {#breaking-changes-4.6.b}

- New Cluster Groups will now default to a newer version of vCluster,
  [version 0.22.x](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/releases), which includes new features and improvements. Existing
  Cluster Groups will continue to use older versions. If you want to use a later version of vCluster, refer to the
  [Palette Virtual Clusters](../clusters/palette-virtual-clusters/palette-virtual-clusters.md#upgrade-virtual-clusters)
  page to learn how to migrate your virtual cluster workloads.

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where tags that contained spaces prevented [AWS](../clusters/public-cloud/aws/aws.md) clusters from
  being deployed via API.
- Fixed an issue where simultaneous updates to [EKS](../clusters/public-cloud/aws/eks.md) logging and VPC configuration
  caused reconciliation failures due to API limitations.
- Fixed an issue in [MAAS](../clusters/data-center/maas/maas.md) clusters where only the first node pool got repaved
  when a full cluster repave was expected.
- Fixed a UI discrepancy where the worker node count on the cluster **Review** page displayed the **Number of nodes in
  pool** instead of the **Minimum size** and **Maximum size** for clusters with autoscaler enabled. This did not affect
  cluster functionality.
- Fixed an issue that caused repeated reconciliation errors when deploying an [EKS](../clusters/public-cloud/aws/eks.md)
  cluster with private cluster endpoint access. This did not affect cluster functionality.
- Fixed an issue during cluster setup where selecting **Copy from Control Plane Pool** would reset certain worker pool
  configurations, such as autoscaler. Copied changes are now restricted to cloud configurations.

#### Improvements

- Palette and VerteX emails have been redesigned to ensure consistency and improve accessibility. The updates have been
  applied to sign-up, login, password reset, and billing update emails.
- ResourceQuota and LimitRange resources are now set in the `system-upgrade` namespace.

#### Deprecations and Removals

- Palette no longer integrates with the [libvirt](https://libvirt.org/) virtualization API. Support has been removed
  across various components including the Palette UI, Terraform providers, the user interface, and packs.

### Edge

#### Features

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- <TpBadge /> Palette now allows the configuration of an in-cluster primary registry that stores the images required for
  cluster deployment. Any OCI-compliant registry can be configured as the primary registry. Palette offers
  out-of-the-box support for Zot and Harbor registries with minimum configuration required. 
  Refer to [Deploy Cluster with Primary Registry](../clusters/edge/site-deployment/deploy-custom-registries/deploy-primary-registry.md) for
  further information.
- The [Palette CLI](../automation/palette-cli/palette-cli.md) has a new `content` command that supports the creation of
  [content bundles](../clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/palette-canvos/build-content-bundle.md). This command provides
  the ability to create bundles directly from the command-line. Refer to the
  [Content](../automation/palette-cli/commands/content.md) command reference page for further information.

#### Improvements

- [Local UI](../clusters/edge/local-ui/local-ui.md) has been updated with a new color scheme and logo. These new
  elements are displayed across the entire product interface. Check out the
  [Welcome to the fold: meet the new Spectro Cloud brand](https://www.spectrocloud.com/blog/meet-the-new-spectro-cloud-brand)
  blog post to learn more.

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue that prevented DNS configuration changes made using the Terminal User Interface (TUI) from being
  applied without restarting the `CoreDNS` deployment.
- Fixed an issue where password updates were delayed on appliance mode [Edge](../clusters/edge/edge.md) hosts.

#### Deprecations and Removals

[Spectro Cloud Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs) is
available. For more details, refer to the Terraform provider
[release page](https://github.com/spectrocloud/terraform-provider-spectrocloud/releases).

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue that resulted in Admin Kubeconfig files to be fetched instead of the Kubeconfig file when using the
  `kubeconfig` field on cluster resources. Refer to the
  [Kubeconfig Files](../clusters/cluster-management/kubeconfig.md#kubeconfig-files) for more details.

## March 28, 2025 - Release 4.6.18

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where users could not connect to Edge hosts using
  [remote shell](../clusters/edge/cluster-management/remote-shell.md) in VerteX SaaS environments.
- Fixed an issue that prevented host machines from automatically rebooting after installing the
  [Palette agent](../deployment-modes/agent-mode/install-agent-host.md).
- Fixed an issue that prevented [AWS](../clusters/public-cloud/aws/aws.md) clusters with tags containing certain special
  characters from being provisioned or deleted.
- Fixed an issue where [Edge](../clusters/edge/edge.md) native clusters remained stuck in the bootstrapping phase during
  deployment.

### Security Notices

- On March 24, 2025, a security vulnerability regarding certain versions of
  [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) was reported. The vulnerable versions were used in
  Palette's and VerteX's management planes and were also available as packs for workload clusters. As of April 4, 2025,
  all vulnerable Nginx packs have been deprecated, all managed Palette instances have been patched, and patches are
  available for connected and airgapped Palette Enterprise and VerteX versions 4.4 - 4.6.

  All workload clusters across all Palette and VerteX installations must be updated manually. All users should review
  their [cluster profiles](../profiles/cluster-profiles/cluster-profiles.md) and workload clusters and upgrade the Nginx
  pack to version `1.11.5`. For more information, refer to our
  [Security Advisory](../security-bulletins/security-advisories/security-advisories.md).

## March 20, 2025 - Release 4.6.13

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where [AWS EKS](../clusters/public-cloud/aws/eks.md) clusters using the AWS VPC CNI (Helm)
  [pack](../integrations/integrations.mdx) assigned incorrect IP addresses to pods.
- Fixed an issue where OIDC configuration failed when using
  [Microsoft Entra ID](../user-management/saml-sso/palette-sso-with-entra-id.md).

### Palette Enterprise {#palette-enterprise-4-6-a}

#### Features

- The Palette UI has been updated with a new color scheme and logo. These new elements are displayed on the login page,
  left **Main Menu**, and product tour. Check out the
  [Welcome to the fold: meet the new Spectro Cloud brand](https://www.spectrocloud.com/blog/meet-the-new-spectro-cloud-brand)
  blog post to learn more.
- Palette and VerteX emails have been updated with a new color scheme and logo. The visual elements match the changes
  made to the Palette UI.
- [Azure IaaS clusters](../clusters/public-cloud/azure/azure.md) now support autoscaling functionality. This
  functionality allows Palette to scale the worker pool horizontally based on its per-node workload counts. Autoscaling
  can be enabled during cluster creation or by changing the
  [worker node pool configuration](../clusters/cluster-management/node-pool.md#worker-node-pool). Refer to the
  [Create and Manage Azure IaaS Cluster](../clusters/public-cloud/azure/create-azure-cluster.md) guide for further
  information.
- [Agent mode](../deployment-modes/agent-mode/agent-mode.md) feature has now exited Tech Preview and is ready to use for
  production workloads. Check out the [Install Palette Agent](../deployment-modes/agent-mode/install-agent-host.md)
  guide for further details.

#### Improvements

- The [cluster filtering](../clusters/cluster-management/cluster-map-filters.md) functionality of the Palette UI has
  been modified to add the **Deleted** option under the **Status** filter. This improvement provides a simplified
  process of managing and filtering cluster views.
- Palette's internal database, MongoDB, has been upgraded to version 7.0.

#### Deprecations and Removals

- The `PROXY_CERT_PATH` variable is no longer available in the CanvOS build process. Use the **certs** folder in the
  root of the project directory to store proxy certificates. The **certs** folder is automatically included in the
  CanvOS build process. Refer to the
  [Build Provider Images](../clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/palette-canvos/build-provider-images.md) for guidance on
  using the **certs** folder to pass proxy certificates to the CanvOS build process.
- Palette's internal message communication between components transitioned from NATS to gRPC. The previous usage of NATS
  has been removed. This change primarily affects customers using Palette agents on versions older than 4.0, and the
  NATS namespace must be [manually removed](../troubleshooting/nodes.md#scenario---remove-deprecated-nats-namespace)
  from affected clusters. To learn more about Palette's internal network architecture, refer to the
  [Network Ports](../architecture/networking-ports.md) page. If you are using network proxies, we recommend you review
  the [gRPC and Proxies](../architecture/grps-proxy.md) documentation for potential issues.

### Edge

#### Features

- <TpBadge /> Palette introduces a remote shell capability for troubleshooting remote edge hosts. This new feature
  allows direct shell access via Palette without depending on user credentials or an active Kubernetes cluster. Refer to
  the [Remote Shell](../clusters/edge/cluster-management/remote-shell.md) guide for further information.

#### Improvements

- Edge clusters now support
  [automatic certificate renewal](../clusters/cluster-management/certificate-management.md#automatic-certificate-renewal)
  for clusters that are not connected to Palette. Auto-renewal ensures that certificates are updated with minimal
  downtime.

### VerteX

## March 3, 2025 - Release 4.6.9

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue that caused [Local UI](../clusters/edge/local-ui/local-ui.md) to incorrectly show the configuration
  status of healthy edge hosts as "Not Configured." This issue did not affect any other edge cluster operations.

## February 28, 2025 - Release 4.6.8

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue that caused TLS 1.0 and 1.1 to be incorrectly enabled by internal
  [Local UI](../clusters/edge/local-ui/local-ui.md) services. All services are now using TLS 1.2.
- Fixed an issue that caused the [metrics server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server) deployment to be
  created without any resource limits. Resource quotas are now correctly applied, preventing the server from interfering
  with critical cluster functions.
- Fixed an issue that caused edge nodes to pull images from external registries instead of the local image cache.
  Cluster deployment now progresses with local images.
- Fixed an issue that K3s certificate renewals to be incorrectly applied to
  [Two-node Edge clusters](../clusters/edge/architecture/two-node.md).
- Fixed an issue that caused signed images to fail to be loaded by K3s [edge clusters](../clusters/edge/edge.md).
- Fixed an issue that allowed [Local UI](../clusters/edge/local-ui/local-ui.md) to start updates on inaccessible
  clusters, resulting in inconsistent configurations. Updates are now allowed only on accessible clusters.
- Fixed an issue that allowed concurrent NTP updates to be triggered from the
  [Local UI](../clusters/edge/local-ui/local-ui.md) and API. Only one update can be in progress now.
- Fixed an issue where installing a Palette [pack](../integrations/integrations.mdx) through a Helm chart incorrectly
  sets the Helm install version.
- Fixed an issue where NTP settings modified via [Local UI](../clusters/edge/local-ui/local-ui.md) did not persist.

### Features

#### Edge

- Certificate renewal periods can now be configured for [edge clusters](../clusters/edge/edge.md) using a ConfigMap. You
  can configure the renewal period using the `cert-renewal-day` field in the `palette-edge-config` ConfigMap.

  production workloads. Check out the
  [Cluster Profile Variables](../profiles/cluster-profiles/create-cluster-profiles/define-profile-variables/define-profile-variables.md)
  guide to learn more about this feature.

- [Self-hosted Palette](../enterprise-version/enterprise-version.md) installations now offer complete brand
  customization. System operators can apply custom logos and color schemes to the instances they manage by using the
  **Customize interface** tab in the **Administration** panel of the system console. Refer to the
  [Customize Interface](../enterprise-version/system-management/customize-interface.md) guide to learn more.

#### Improvements

- The [rate limit](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/api/introduction/#rate-limits) for Palette API endpoints with a prefix
  of `/v1/cloudconfigs` has been increased to 50 requests per second per IP address, and the maximum burst has been
  increased to 250 requests per second per IP address.

- The propagation of [Azure cloud credentials](../clusters/public-cloud/azure/azure-cloud.md) has been improved to
  ensure that Palette automatically updates cluster secrets. This improvement ensures that clusters with expired
  credentials are updated immediately to prevent disruptions.

### Edge

#### Features

- <TpBadge /> Palette now supports a two-node architecture, which provides a High Availability (HA) mode. Users can
  enable this feature by toggling the high availability mode during cluster configuration. In HA mode, etcd is replaced
  with Postgres and [Kine](https://github.com/k3s-io/kine). Refer to the [Two-Node
  Architecture](../clusters/edge/architecture/two-node.md) page for further details.

### VerteX

#### Features

- Includes all Palette features, improvements, breaking changes, and deprecations in this release. Refer to the
  [Palette section](#palette-enterprise-4-6-6) for more details.

- [Palette VerteX](../vertex/vertex.md) now offers complete brand customization. System operators can apply custom logos
  and color schemes to the instances they manage by using the **Customize interface** tab in the **Administration**
  panel in the system control. Refer to the [Customize Interface](../vertex/system-management/customize-interface.md)
  guide to learn more.

### Automation

#### Features

- Terraform version 0.23.0 of the
  [Spectro Cloud Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs) is
  available. For more details, refer to the Terraform provider
  [release page](https://github.com/spectrocloud/terraform-provider-spectrocloud/releases).

- All Terraform cluster resources now support
  [Cluster Profile Variables](../profiles/cluster-profiles/create-cluster-profiles/define-profile-variables/define-profile-variables.md)
  management in non-Edge and connected Edge clusters. For more information, refer to the Spectro Cloud Terraform
  provider [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs).

- A new Terraform resource, `spectrocloud_resource_limit`, is now available for managing Palette
  [resource limits](../tenant-settings/palette-resource-limits.md). By default, a resource limit is configured in
  Palette with default values. Users can now update the limits with Terraform. For more information, refer to the
  Spectro Cloud Terraform provider
  [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs).

#### Improvements

- Palette will now automatically use the most recent Pack version when no version is specified in Terraform resources.
  This improvement streamlines the user process of identifying and pulling the latest pack versions directly. Versions
  can still be defined explicitly. For more information, refer to the Spectro Cloud Terraform provider
  [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs).

- The `--validate` flag of the Palette [EC](../automation/palette-cli/commands/ec.md) command now supports validation of
  airgapped environments. Previously, only environments that had internet access were supported. Refer to the
  [Validate Environment](../automation/palette-cli/commands/ec.md#validate-environment) section for further information.

- The Terraform OCI registry resource, `spectrocloud_registry_oci`, now supports Zarf and Pack
  [OCI Registry](../registries-and-packs/registries/oci-registry/oci-registry.md) types. Previously, only Helm
  registries were supported. For more information, refer to the Spectro Cloud Terraform provider
  [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs).

### Virtual Machine Orchestrator (VMO)

#### Improvements

- The [Virtual Machine Migration Assistant](../vm-management/vm-migration-assistant/vm-migration-assistant.md) now
  allows TLS configuration for ingress resources, enhancing security through HTTPS access. This capability provides a
  unified and secure setup experience for users managing virtual machine migrations. Refer to the
  [Create a VM Migration Assistant Profile](../vm-management/vm-migration-assistant/create-vm-migration-assistant-profile.md)
  guide to learn more.

- The KubeVirt version in use is now v1.4.0. Other minor maintenance updates in support of KubeVirt 1.4.0 are also
  included.

### Packs

#### Pack Notes

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

- Palette's support for <VersionedLink text="MicroK8s" url="/integrations/packs/?pack=kubernetes-microk8s" /> 1.29 and 1.30 has been enhanced to provide airgap support, as well as deployments on [MAAS](../clusters/data-center/maas/maas.md) and [AWS](../clusters/public-cloud/aws/aws.md). Additionally, this update validates multi-node control planes.

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

- Due to Google's
  [decision to deprecate](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/transition/transition-from-gcr) the `gcr.io`
  container registry, we have added a new image registry that Palette agents will use to pull images. The new registry
  is `us-docker.pkg.dev`. This was [announced](./announcements.md#removals) as part of the Palette 4.5.3 release. If you
  have network restrictions in place, ensure that the new registry is allowed. The migration of images to this new
  registry is now complete. Redirects from the old registry to the new registry are in place, so no user actions are
  required at this time. Refer to the [Proxy Requirements](../enterprise-version/install-palette/#proxy-requirements)
  for a complete list of domains that must be allowed.

- The Palette eXtended Kubernetes (PXK) version 1.32.1 pack does not currently support
  [AWS](../clusters/public-cloud/aws/aws.md) and [GCP](../clusters/public-cloud/gcp/gcp.md) cluster deployments.
