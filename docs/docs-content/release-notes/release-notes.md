## Jun 15, 2024 - Release 4.4.0 - 4.4.4

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
This release contains various new features and improvements. One new feature is the introduction of
[Trusted Boot](../clusters/edge/trusted-boot/trusted-boot.md) for Edge. Trusted Boot is a hardware-based security
feature that ensures that the system boots securely and that the boot process has not been tampered with. We also
improved the MicroK8s experience by exposing lifecycle commands. Other improvements include enhancements to the Cluster
Profile Variables user experience, automatic SSL certificate updates for Edge clusters in airgap environments, and new
network troubleshooting tools in Local UI. Check out the full release notes to learn more about this release's new
features and improvements.

### Security Notices

- Review the [Security Bulletins](../security-bulletins/security-bulletins.md) page for the latest security advisories.

### Palette

#### Breaking Changes

- In this release, Palette aligns Google Cloud Platform GKE behavior with Azure AKS and AWS EKS and removes the ability
  to specify a patch version when creating a cluster profile for AKS, EKS, and GKE. Only the major and minor versions
  are available for selection. The underlying cloud provider will automatically select the latest patch version
  available for the selected major and minor version.

- Validator Helm Charts have migrated from `https://github.com/spectrocloud-labs/validator` to
  `https://github.com/validator-labs/validator`. Former versions of the Palette CLI will point to the former repository
  when prompted for the Helm chart location and require a manual URL change. The new version of the Palette CLI will
  point to the new repository. Refer to the [Validator](../automation/palette-cli/commands/validator.md) CLI page
  documentation for more details.

- Due to the removal of GKE Kubernetes patch versions, it's critical you update existing cluster profiles to use the new
  GKE Kubernetes packs to avoid issues. Active clusters using old GKE Kubernetes pack versions may encounter problems
  like pods failing to start and scaling issues. We recommend deploying new clusters with the updated GKE cluster
  profile and migrating workloads.

#### Features

- <TpBadge /> The MicroK8s pack layer now exposes `bootCommands`, `preRunCommands` and `postRunCommands`. You can use
  these commands to customize and configure MicroK8s as needed. MicroK8s is delivered as a Technical Preview for AWS and
  Canonical MAAS in this release. To learn more, refer to the MicroK8s pack
  [documentation](../integrations/microk8s.md).

#### Improvements

- You can now upload a custom pack to a self-hosted OCI registry multiple times by using different namespaces in the OCI
  repository.

- This release removes terminology that may be culturally insensitive or create a barrier to inclusion. We removed the
  term "master" from our product and replaced it with "control-plane". This work aligns with the Linux Foundation
  initiative for [Diversity & Inclusivity](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/diversity-inclusivity).

#### Bug Fixes

- The issue where Google GKE cluster deployments failed is now resolved. You can now deploy GKE clusters using the
  latest available GKE versions.

#### Deprecations and Removals

- The term _master_ is removed from Palette and replaced with the term, _control plane_. This change is reflected in the
  UI, API and documentation. The following API endpoints are affected as a the payload object `includeMasterMachines` is
  deprecated and replaced with the new object, `includeControlPlaneMachines`:

  - POST `/v1/dashboard/spectroclusters/resources/usage`
  - POST `/v1/dashboard/spectroclusters/resources/cost`
  - POST `/v1/dashboard/spectroclusters/{uid}/resources/consumption`
  - POST `/v1/dashboard/spectroclusters/resources/consumption`
  - GET `/v1/metrics/{resourceKind}/{resourceUid}/values`
  - GET `/v1/metrics/{resourceKind}/values`

  <br />

  :::warning

  After six months, the `includeMasterMachines` object will be removed from the API. Use the
  `includeControlPlaneMachines` object moving forward.

  :::

#### Known Issues

- An issue prevents RKE2 and Palette eXtended Kubernetes (PXK) on version 1.29.4 from operating correctly with Canonical
  MAAS. A temporary workaround is using a version lower than 1.29.4 when using MAAS..

- [MicroK8s](../integrations/microk8s.md) does not support a multi-node cluster deployment and is limited to a
  single-node cluster. As a result, the only supported upgrade strategy is `InPlaceUpgrade`.

- Clusters using [MicroK8s](../integrations/microk8s.md) as the Kubernetes distribution, the control plane node fails to
  upgrade when using the `InPlaceUpgrade` strategy for sequential upgrades, such as upgrading from version 1.25.x to
  version 1.26.x and then to version 1.27.x. Refer to the
  [Control Plane Node Fails to Upgrade in Sequential MicroK8s Upgrades](../troubleshooting/pack-issues.md)
  troubleshooting guide for resolution steps.

- If you did not configure the Trusted Boot keys to auto-enroll, manual enrollment could take several times to be
  successful. For more information about key enrollment, refer to
  [Enroll Trusted Boot Keys in Edge Host](../clusters/edge/trusted-boot/deployment-day2/install.md#enroll-secure-boot-keys-into-edge-device).

- Edge hosts with FIPS-compliant RHEL Operating System (OS) distribution may encounter the error where the
  `systemd-resolved.service` service enters the **failed** state. This prevents the nameserver from being configured,
  which will result in cluster deployment failure. Refer to
  [TroubleShooting](../troubleshooting/edge.md#scenario---systemd-resolvedservice-enters-failed-state) for a workaround.

### Edge

#### Features

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- <TpBadge /> [Trusted Boot](../clusters/edge/trusted-boot/trusted-boot.md) is an exciting new Edge capability developed as part of the [SENA
  framework](https://www.spectrocloud.com/product/sena). Trusted Boot is a hardware-based security feature that ensures that the system boots securely and that the boot process has
  not been tampered with. Trusted Boot does several significant things, all working in concert, to enhance security: 
  - Ensures that only trusted software can boot on the system. Any modification to any part of the hard disk will be detected. 
  - Encrypts all sensitive data on disk using hardware security Trusted Platform Module (TPM). 
  - Ensures that the TPM will only decrypt sensitive data if the boot process is clean and untampered.

  Unlike similar solutions, Trusted Boot utilizes a secure boot, measured boot, and encryption to protect 
  the booting system far more than other solutions. To learn more about Edge Trusted Boot, check out the
  [Edge Trusted Boot documentation](../clusters/edge/trusted-boot/trusted-boot.md).

#### Improvements

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- <TpBadge /> The Cluster Profile Variables user experience has been improved. Users can now identify where a variable is used, preview the variable during creation time, and change the order of the variables displayed. An improved Day-2 management experience is also available. You can learn more about these new features in the [Cluster Profile Variables](../profiles/cluster-profiles/create-cluster-profiles/define-profile-variables.md) documentation.


- Edge clusters managed by [LocalUI](../clusters/edge/local-ui/local-ui.md) now receive automatic SSL certificate updates for Kubernetes. Users can also manually trigger the SSL certificate update process. For more information, refer to the [Renew Certificates for Airgap Clusters](../clusters/edge/cluster-management/certificate-renewal.md) guide.

- [Local UI](../clusters/edge/local-ui/local-ui.md) now includes tools to help users troubleshoot network issues. The tools include ping and traceroute. For more information, refer to the [Local UI](../clusters/edge/local-ui/local-ui.md) documentation.

- Clusters managed by [Local UI](../clusters/edge/local-ui/local-ui.md) now include a new feature that allows users to download diagnostic logs from Local UI. This feature reduces the friction of troubleshooting issues on the cluster as the need to SSH into the cluster is reduced.

- Support for custom links, URLs, and static pages is now available in Local UI. You can populate custom links in the left **Main Menu** of [Local UI](../clusters/edge/local-ui/host-management/custom-link.md), which will either load content into in an iframe or act as en external link. You can also can host static pages in Local UI. This is useful when you need to deploy and host custom or specific content for a site and want to avoid introducing additional services to host a static site.

### Palette Dev Engine (PDE)

#### Known Issues

- During the platform upgrade from Palette 4.3 to 4.4,
  [Virtual Clusters](../clusters/palette-virtual-clusters/palette-virtual-clusters.md) may encounter a scenario where
  the pod `palette-controller-manager` is not upgraded to the newer version of Palette. The virtual cluster will
  continue to be operational, and this does not impact its functionality. Refer to the
  [Controller Manager Pod Not Upgraded](../troubleshooting/palette-dev-engine.md#scenario---controller-manager-pod-not-upgraded)
  troubleshooting guide for resolution steps.

### Virtual Machine Orchestrator (VMO)

#### Improvements

- The KubeVirt version in use is now v1.2.0. Other minor maintenance updates in support of Kubevirt 1.2.0 are also
  included.

<!-- ### VerteX

#### Features

- You can now deploy Palette VerteX using Red Hat Linux Enterprise (RHEL) as the Operating System (OS) for the VerteX
  instance nodes. Using RHEL as the base OS is available for VerteX when deployed to a VMware vSphere environment using
  the Palette CLI. A prompt will ask you to select the OS during the VerteX deployment process. Refer to the Palette
  VerteX installation [guide](../vertex/install-palette-vertex/install-on-vmware/install.md) for more details. -->

### Automation

- Terraform version 0.20.0 of the
  [Spectro Cloud Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs) is
  available. For more details, refer to the Terraform provider
  [release page](https://github.com/spectrocloud/terraform-provider-spectrocloud/releases).

- Palette Crossplane provider version 0.20.0 is available. For more details, refer to the provider
  [release page](https://github.com/crossplane-contrib/provider-palette/releases).

- The Terraform data resources,
  [`spectrocloud_pack`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs/data-sources/pack)
  and
  [`spectrocloud_pack_simple`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs/data-sources/pack_simple),
  will both require the attribute `registry_uid` to be set the next Terraform release, 0.21.0. We recommend you start
  using this attribute in your Terraform configurations to avoid issues in the future.

### Docs and Education

- [Palette's Crossplane provider](https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers/crossplane-contrib/provider-palette/latest)
  now has a dedicated documentation section. The new section also includes a few guides on how to deploy a Kubernetes
  clusters using Crossplane. Check out the [Crossplane Provider](../automation/crossplane/crossplane.md) documentation
  for more details.

### Packs

#### Pack Notes

- Cluster Autoscaler version 1.29.2 is a Helm-based pack. Previous versions of the pack were manifest-based. Upgrades to
  the new version require you to select the new Helm-based pack.

- The BYOOS pack is now available for Palette VerteX deployments. This allows users to bring their own Operating System
  (OS) image to deploy VerteX instances. RHEL is the only custom OS supported for VerteX deployments at this time.

- MicroK8s now supports boot, `preRun` and `postRun` commands on cloud-init. This allows users to execute custom
  commands before and after their MicroK8s deployment processes, providing enhanced flexibility and control over
  deployment environments.

- The Kubernetes pack parameter `k8sHardening` is removed and no longer used as the method for hardening images during
  the image creation process. This change does not impact users.

- Cluster Autoscaler is now a verified pack. Refer to the [Verified Packs](../integrations/verified_packs.md) page for
  more details on verified packs.
