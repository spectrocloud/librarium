## August 30, 2026 - Release 4.10.0 {#release-notes-4.10.0}

### Security Notices

- Review the [Security Bulletins](../security-bulletins/reports/reports.mdx) page for the latest security advisories.

### Palette Enterprise {#palette-enterprise-4.10.0}

#### Breaking Changes {#breaking-changes-4.10.0}

#### Features

<!-- https://spectrocloud.atlassian.net/browse/PCP-7210 -->

- Apache CloudStack support is now generally available. Palette removes the **ApacheCloudStack** feature flag and
  enables Apache CloudStack for all tenants. You can deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters in your Apache CloudStack
  environment through a Private Cloud Gateway (PCG). Refer to
  [Apache CloudStack](../clusters/data-center/cloudstack/cloudstack.md) for more information.

<!-- https://spectrocloud.atlassian.net/browse/PCP-6899 -->

- Canonical Kubernetes (CK8s) clusters on MAAS now support SSH key management. You can configure **SSH Keys** on the
  cluster's cloud configuration during cluster creation and on Day-2 through the Palette UI, API, Terraform provider,
  and Crossplane provider, on both Palette and Palette VerteX. Palette injects the keys into the `spectro` user's
  `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on every control plane and worker node, and preserves any users that MAAS or the machine
  image already configured. Refer to
  [SSH Keys on MAAS Cluster Nodes](../clusters/data-center/maas/architecture.md#ssh-keys-on-maas-cluster-nodes) for more
  information.

#### Improvements

<!-- https://spectrocloud.atlassian.net/browse/PEM-11712 -->

- The **Host LXD-based control planes** and **Use LXD VMs** toggles in cluster and node configuration now display a
  tooltip clarifying that LXD-based VMs on MAAS are supported only with Palette eXtended Kubernetes clusters. Enabling
  LXD with other Kubernetes distributions results in deployment failures.

#### Bug Fixes

<!-- https://spectrocloud.atlassian.net/browse/PEM-11657 -->

- Fixed an issue where using the Palette UI to open and save a
  [cluster profile](../profiles/cluster-profiles/cluster-profiles.md) created with the API or Terraform could reorder
  its packs, surfacing as unexpected `terraform plan` drift for profiles managed as code.
