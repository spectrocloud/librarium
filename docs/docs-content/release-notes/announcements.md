| The [Palette Edge CLI](../downloads/cli-tools.md#palette-edge-cli) is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. We recommend using the [Palette CLI](../automation/palette-cli/palette-cli.md) for the creation and management of content bundles. Refer to the [Build Content Bundle](../clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/palette-canvos/build-content-bundle.md) guide for further information.                                                                                                     | _To be announced_   | May 25, 2025   |
| The `stylus.installationMode` [Edge Installer Configuration](../clusters/edge/edge-configuration/installer-reference.md) flag is deprecated. We recommend using the `stylus.managementMode` flag instead, which has two allowed values: `central`, which means the Edge host is connected to Palette, and `local`, which means the Edge host has no connection to a Palette instance. Refer to the [Prepare User Data](../clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/prepare-user-data.md) guide for further information. | December 6, 2025  | May 25, 2025   |

| The `spec.jsonCredentialsFileUid` field in API requests is no longer available. Users who create GCP cloud accounts using the API should use the `spec.jsonCredentials` field to supply their credentials in JSON format. Refer to the [API documentation](/api/introduction) for further details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 4.7.b   | September 13, 2025 |
| The `spectrocloud_macro` Terraform resource is no longer available. We recommend using the `spectrocloud_macros` resource to create and manage service output variables and macros. For more information, refer to the Spectro Cloud Terraform provider [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 4.7.b   | September 13, 2025 |
| The `tc` subcommand of the [Palette CLI](../automation/palette-cli/palette-cli.md) is no longer available. This command provided functionality for deploying target clusters using the Palette CLI. We recommend using the [Spectro Cloud Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs) for cluster deployment automation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 4.7.13  | August 17, 2025    |
| The `PROXY_CERT_PATH` variable is no longer available in the CanvOS build process. Use the **certs** folder in the root of the project directory to store proxy certificates. The **certs** folder is automatically included in the CanvOS build process. Refer to the [Build Provider Images](../clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/palette-canvos/build-provider-images.md) for guidance on using the **certs** folder to pass proxy certificates to the CanvOS build process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 4.6.12  | March 15, 2025     |
| Palette's internal message communication between components transitioned from NATS to gRPC. The previous usage of NATS has been removed. This change primarily affects customers using Palette agents on versions older than 4.0. If your clusters still use agents on version 3.x or older, [resume agent upgrades](../clusters/cluster-management/platform-settings/pause-platform-upgrades.md) to avoid disrupting critical functions such as health monitoring and heartbeat publishing. To learn more about Palette's internal network architecture, refer to the [Network Ports](../architecture/networking-ports.md) page. If you are using network proxies, we recommend you review the [gRPC and Proxies](../architecture/grps-proxy.md) documentation for potential issues. | 4.6.12  | March 15, 2025     |
| The Palette CLI now requires an encryption passphrase for various commands. The passphrase can be set as an environment variable or using a CLI command flag. The passphrase encrypts and decrypts sensitive data, such as secrets, in the CLI configuration files. Refer to the [Palette CLI Encryption](../automation/palette-cli/palette-cli.md#encryption) section to learn more about the encryption passphrase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 4.5.20  | January 18, 2024   |
| The Terraform resource, `spectrocloud_cluster_import` is removed. To import a cluster deployed outside of the context of Palette, refer to the [Import a Cluster](../clusters/imported-clusters/cluster-import.md) guide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 4.5.20  | January 18, 2024   |
| Due to Google's decision to deprecate the `gcr.io` container registry, we are adding a new image registry that Palette agents will use to pull images. The new registry is `us-docker.pkg.dev`. If you have network restrictions in place, ensure that the new registry is allowed. Ensure network connections to `grc.io` are allowed until the migration is complete. The new registry is available for use starting with this release. Refer to the Proxy Requirements for a complete list of domains that must be allowed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 4.5.3   | October 13, 2024   |
| In this release, Palette aligns Google Cloud Platform GKE behavior with Azure AKS and AWS EKS and removes the ability to specify a patch version when creating a cluster profile for AKS, EKS, and GKE. Only the major and minor versions are available for selection. The underlying cloud provider will automatically select the latest patch version available for the selected major and minor version.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 4.4.6   | Jun 15, 2024       |
