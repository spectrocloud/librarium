| When upgrading airgapped self-hosted Palette and VerteX clusters to 4.6.32, the IPAM controller may report an `Exhausted IP Pools` error despite having available IP addresses, preventing the cluster from upgrading. This is due to a race condition in CAPV version 1.12.0, which may lead to an orphaned IP claim.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Delete the orphaned IP claim and re-run the upgrade.

| The AWS CSI pack has a [Pod Disruption Budget](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/) (PDB) that allows for a maximum of one unavailable pod. This behavior causes an issue for single-node clusters as well as clusters with a single control plane node and a single worker node where the control plane lacks worker capability. [Operating System (OS) patch](../clusters/cluster-management/os-patching.md) updates may attempt to evict the CSI controller without success, resulting in the node remaining in the un-schedulable state.                                            | If OS patching is enabled, allow the control plane nodes to have worker capability.

| When provisioning an Edge cluster, it's possible that some Operating System (OS) user credentials will be lost once the cluster is active. This is because the cloud-init stages from different sources merge during the deployment process, and sometimes, the same stages without distinct names overwrite each other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Give each of your cloud-init stages in the OS pack and in the Edge installer **user-data** file a unique name.

| When you use a content bundle to provision a new cluster without using the local Harbor registry, it's possible for the images to be pulled from external networks instead of from the content bundle, consuming network bandwidth. If your Edge host has no connection to external networks or if it cannot locate the image on a remote registry, some pods may enter the `ImagePullBackOff` state at first, but eventually the pods will be created using images from the content bundle.                                                                                                                        | For connected clusters, you can make sure that the remote images are not reachable by the Edge host, which will stop the Palette agent from downloading the image and consuming bandwidth, and eventually the cluster will be created using images from the content bundle. For airgap clusters, the `ImagePullBackOff` error will eventually resolve on its own and there is no action to take.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | July 11, 2024      | Edge                         |

| Deploying self-hosted Palette or VerteX to a vSphere environment fails if vCenter has standalone hosts directly under a data center. Persistent Volume (PV) provisioning fails due to an upstream issue with the vSphere Container Storage Interface (CSI) for all versions before v3.2.0.

The issue may also occur in workload clusters deployed on vSphere using the same vSphere CSI for storage volume provisioning.                                                                                                                           | If you encounter the following error message when deploying self-hosted Palette or VerteX: `'ProvisioningFailed failed to provision volume with StorageClass "spectro-storage-class". Error: failed to fetch hosts from entity ComputeResource:domain-xyz` then use the following workaround. Remove standalone hosts directly under the data center from vCenter and allow the volume provisioning to complete. After the volume is provisioned, you can add the standalone hosts back. You can also use a service account that does not have access to the standalone hosts as the user that deployed Palette. | May 21, 2024       | Self-Hosted                  |

| For clusters deployed with [agent mode](../deployment-modes/agent-mode/agent-mode.md) on Palette agent version 4.5.14, having a custom `stylus.path` defined in the **user-data** file causes Kubernetes upgrades to fail.

| If an Edge host operating a cluster in connected mode loses connection to Palette, the cluster will not auto-renew its Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificates. When it re-establishes the connection to Palette, the Edge host will renew the certificates if the existing certificates have less than 30 days before they expire.                                                                                                                                                          | March 15, 2025     | Edge                | 4.6.12      |
| [Cluster Removal](../clusters/cluster-management/remove-clusters.md) of Palette and VerteX clusters will get stuck if you attempt to delete a cluster with expired cloud account credentials.

| K3s certificate renewals for [Two-node Edge clusters](../clusters/edge/architecture/two-node.md) are not managed by Palette. Two-node clusters will use a default certificate list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | February 17, 2025  | Edge                | 4.6.8       |
| Clusters that are currently deployed and attempting to upgrade from Kubernetes version 1.31.1 to newer versions are getting stuck in the upgrade state. This issue also affects Day-2 operations related to changes in the Kubernetes layer YAML and the resize of control plane nodes for clusters using Kubernetes version 1.31.1. The root of the problem is an internal conversion error stemming from an internal type change introduced in Kubernetes version 1.31.x.                       | January 19, 2025   | Clusters, Packs     | 4.6.0       |

| A change in the [Edge Cluster](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/api/v1/v-1-spectro-clusters-edge-native-create/) API endpoint affects Terraform and API workflows for Edge cluster creation or modification. The field `spec.cloudConfig.controlPlaneEndpoint.type` no longer accepts IP addresses. The accepted values are now `VIP`, `External`, and `DDNS`. As a result, API and Terraform workflows for Edge cluster creation or modification that use the IP address are currently unavailable. | September 18, 2024 | Edge                | 4.4.19      |
| In a VMware environment, self-hosted Palette instances do not receive a unique cluster ID when deployed, which can cause issues during a node repave event, such as a Kubernetes version upgrade. Specifically, Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) will experience start problems due to the lack of a unique cluster ID.                                                                                                                                               | April 14, 2024     | Self-Hosted         | 4.4.14      |

| Deploying self-hosted Palette or VerteX to a vSphere environment fails if vCenter has standalone hosts directly under a data center. Persistent Volume (PV) provisioning fails due to an upstream issue with the vSphere Container Storage Interface (CSI) for all versions before v3.2.0. Palette and VerteX use the vSphere CSI version 3.1.2 internally. The issue may also occur in workload clusters deployed on vSphere using the same vSphere CSI for storage volume provisioning.         | July 20, 2024      | Self-Hosted         | 4.4.11      |
| When you upgrade VerteX from version 4.3.x to 4.4.x, a few system pods may remain unhealthy and experience _CrashLoopBackOff_ errors. This issue only impacts VMware vSphere-based installations and occurs because the internal Mongo DNS is incorrectly configured in the `configserver` ConfigMap.                                                                                                                                                                                             | June 29, 2024      | Self-Hosted, VerteX | 4.4.7       |
