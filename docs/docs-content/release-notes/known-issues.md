| Deploying self-hosted Palette or VerteX to a vSphere environment fails if vCenter has standalone hosts directly under a Datacenter. Persistent Volume (PV) provisioning fails due to an upstream issue with the vSphere Container Storage Interface (CSI) for all versions before v3.2.0. Palette and VerteX use the vSphere CSI version 3.1.2 internally. The issue may also occur in workload clusters deployed on vSphere using the same vSphere CSI for storage volume provisioning. | If you encounter the following error message when deploying self-hosted Palette or VerteX: `'ProvisioningFailed failed to provision volume with StorageClass "spectro-storage-class". Error: failed to fetch hosts from entity ComputeResource:domain-xyz` then use the following workaround. Remove standalone hosts directly under the Datacenter from vCenter and allow the volume provisioning to complete. After the volume is provisioned, you can add the standalone hosts back. You can also use a service account that does not have access to the standalone hosts as the user that deployed Palette. | May 21, 2024   | Self-Hosted       |
| Conducting cluster node scaling operations on a cluster undergoing a backup can lead to issues and potential unresponsiveness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | To avoid this, ensure no backup operations are in progress before scaling nodes or performing other cluster operations that change the cluster state                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | April 14, 2024 | Clusters          |
| Palette automatically creates an AWS security group for worker nodes using the format `<cluster-name>-node`. If a security group with the same name already exists in the VPC, the cluster creation process fails.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | To avoid this, ensure that no security group with the same name exists in the VPC before creating a cluster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | April 14, 2024 | Clusters          |

| If a Kubernetes cluster deployed onto VMware is deleted, and later re-created with the same name, the cluster creation process fails. The issue is caused by existing resources remaining inside the PCG, or the System PCG, that are not cleaned up during the cluster deletion process.                                                                                                                                                                                                | Refer to the [VMware Resources Remain After Cluster Deletion](../troubleshooting/pcg.md#scenario---vmware-resources-remain-after-cluster-deletion) troubleshooting guide for resolution steps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | April 14, 2024 | Clusters          |
| In a VMware environment, self-hosted Palette instances do not receive a unique cluster ID when deployed, which can cause issues during a node repave event, such as a Kubernetes version upgrade. Specifically, PVs and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) will experience start problems due to the lack of a unique cluster ID.                                                                                                                                                           | To resolve this issue, refer to the [Volume Attachment Errors Volume in VMware Environment](../troubleshooting/palette-upgrade.md#volume-attachment-errors-volume-in-vmware-environment) troubleshooting guide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | April 14, 2024 | Self-Hosted       |

| During the cluster provisioning process of new edge clusters, the Palette webhook pods may not always deploy successfully, causing the cluster to be stuck in the provisioning phase. This issue does not impact deployed clusters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Review the [Palette Webhook Pods Fail to Start](../troubleshooting/edge.md#scenario---palette-webhook-pods-fail-to-start) troubleshooting guide for resolution steps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | April 14, 2024 | Edge              |
