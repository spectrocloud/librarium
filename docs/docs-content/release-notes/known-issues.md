| After an OS image upgrade in appliance mode, an Edge host may fail to boot into the expected active system image and instead boot into the passive partition as a fallback due to an upgrade failure. When this happens, the Edge host does not automatically rejoin the cluster. The kernel command line (`/proc/cmdline`) includes the `upgrade_failure` flag and confirms the system root is set to `LABEL=COS_PASSIVE`.| Recover the Edge host manually using one of the following methods:<br /> - Reboot the host and select **Palette eXtended Kubernetes – Edge** at the GRand Unified Bootloader (GRUB) menu to boot the active image.<br /> - Establish an SSH connection to the host and run `/usr/bin/grub2-editenv /oem/grubenv set next_entry=cos && reboot`. This command updates GRUB to use the boot entry labeled `cos` (the active image) and reboots the host.| August 28, 2025| Edge|
| When deploying an Edge RKE2 cluster on Rocky Linux, a worker node may fail to join the cluster if TCP port 9345 is not open on the control plane node. This port is required for communication between the RKE2 agent and the control plane.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Verify if the port is open by running `firewall-cmd --list-all` on the control plane node. If 9345/tcp is not listed in the output, open it with `firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=9345/tcp --permanent` and apply the change using `firewall-cmd --reload`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | July 21, 2025      | Edge                         |

| <!-- prettier-ignore --> Clusters deployed with Microk8s cannot accept kubectl commands if the <VersionedLink text="Spectro Proxy" url="/integrations/packs/?pack=spectro-proxy" /> pack is added to the cluster's cluster profile. The reason behind these issues is Microk8s' lack of support for `certSANs` .

| The AWS CSI pack has a [Pod Disruption Budget](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/) (PDB) that allows for a maximum of one unavailable pod. This behavior causes an issue for single-node clusters as well as clusters with a single control plane node and a single worker node where the control plane lacks worker capability.

| When provisioning an Edge cluster, it's possible that some Operating System (OS) user credentials will be lost once the cluster is active. This is because the cloud-init stages from different sources merge during the deployment process, and sometimes, the same stages without distinct names overwrite each other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Give each of your cloud-init stages in the OS pack and in the Edge installer **user-data** file a unique name.

| When you use a content bundle to provision a new cluster without using the local Harbor registry, it's possible for the images to be pulled from external networks instead of from the content bundle, consuming network bandwidth. If your Edge host has no connection to external networks or if it cannot locate the image on a remote registry, some pods may enter the `ImagePullBackOff` state at first, but eventually the pods will be created using images from the content bundle.                                                                             | For connected clusters, you can make sure that the remote images are not reachable by the Edge host, which will stop the Palette agent from downloading the image and consuming bandwidth, and eventually the cluster will be created using images from the content bundle. For airgap clusters, the `ImagePullBackOff` error will eventually resolve on its own and there is no action to take.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | July 11, 2024      | Edge                         |

| Deploying self-hosted Palette or VerteX to a vSphere environment fails if vCenter has standalone hosts directly under a data center. Persistent Volume (PV) provisioning fails due to an upstream issue with the vSphere Container Storage Interface (CSI) for all versions before v3.2.0. Palette and VerteX use the vSphere CSI version 3.1.2 internally. The issue may also occur in workload clusters deployed on vSphere using the same vSphere CSI for storage volume provisioning.                                                                                | If you encounter the following error message when deploying self-hosted Palette or VerteX: `'ProvisioningFailed failed to provision volume with StorageClass "spectro-storage-class". Error: failed to fetch hosts from entity ComputeResource:domain-xyz` then use the following workaround. Remove standalone hosts directly under the data center from vCenter and allow the volume provisioning to complete. After the volume is provisioned, you can add the standalone hosts back. You can also use a service account that does not have access to the standalone hosts as the user that deployed Palette. | May 21, 2024       | Self-Hosted                  |

| Deploying self-hosted Palette or VerteX to a vSphere environment fails if vCenter has standalone hosts directly under a data center. Persistent Volume (PV) provisioning fails due to an upstream issue with the vSphere Container Storage Interface (CSI) for all versions before v3.2.0. Palette and VerteX use the vSphere CSI version 3.1.2 internally. The issue may also occur in workload clusters deployed on vSphere using the same vSphere CSI for storage volume provisioning.         | July 20, 2024      | Self-Hosted         | 4.4.11      |
| When you upgrade VerteX from version 4.3.x to 4.4.x, a few system pods may remain unhealthy and experience _CrashLoopBackOff_ errors. This issue only impacts VMware vSphere-based installations and occurs because the internal Mongo DNS is incorrectly configured in the `configserver` ConfigMap.                                                                                                                                                                                             | June 29, 2024      | Self-Hosted, VerteX | 4.4.7       |
