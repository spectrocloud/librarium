| Conducting cluster node scaling operations on a cluster undergoing a backup can lead to issues and potential unresponsiveness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | To avoid this, ensure no backup operations are in progress before scaling nodes or performing other cluster operations that change the cluster state                                                                                                                           | April 14, 2024 | Clusters          |
| Palette automatically creates an AWS security group for worker nodes using the format `<cluster-name>-node`. If a security group with the same name already exists in the VPC, the cluster creation process fails.                                                                                                                                  | To avoid this, ensure that no security group with the same name exists in the VPC before creating a cluster.                                                                                                                                                                   | April 14, 2024 | Clusters          |
| K3s version 1.27.7 has been marked as _Deprecated_. This version has a known issue that causes clusters to crash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Upgrade to a newer version of K3s to avoid the issue, such as versions 1.26.12, 1.28.5, and 1.27.11. You can learn more about the issue in the [K3s GitHub issue](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/9047) page.                                                             | April 14, 2024 | Packs, Clusters   |
| When deploying a multi-node AWS EKS cluster with the Container Network Interface (CNI) [Calico](../integrations/calico.md), the cluster deployment fails.                                                                                                                                                                                           | A workaround is to use the AWS VPC CNI in the interim while the issue is resolved.                                                                                                                                                                                             | April 14, 2024 | Packs, Clusters   |
| If a Kubernetes cluster deployed onto VMware is deleted, and later re-created with the same name, the cluster creation process fails. The issue is caused by existing resources remaining inside the PCG, or the System PCG, that are not cleaned up during the cluster deletion process.                                                           | Refer to the [VMware Resources Remain After Cluster Deletion](../troubleshooting/pcg.md#scenario---vmware-resources-remain-after-cluster-deletion) troubleshooting guide for resolution steps.                                                                                 | April 14, 2024 | Clusters          |
| In a VMware environment, self-hosted Palette instances do not receive a unique cluster ID when deployed, which can cause issues during a node repave event, such as a Kubernetes version upgrade. Specifically, Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) will experience start problems due to the lack of a unique cluster ID. | To resolve this issue, refer to the [Volume Attachment Errors Volume in VMware Environment](../troubleshooting/palette-upgrade.md#volume-attachment-errors-volume-in-vmware-environment) troubleshooting guide.                                                                | April 14, 2024 | Self-Hosted       |
| Day-2 operations related to infrastructure changes, such as modifying the node size and count, when using MicroK8s are not taking effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | No workaround is available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | April 14, 2024 | Packs, Clusters   |
| If a cluster that uses the Rook-Ceph pack experiences network issues, it's possible for the file mount to become and remain unavailable even after the network is restored.                                                                                                                                                                         | This a known issue disclosed in the [Rook GitHub repository](https://github.com/rook/rook/issues/13818). To resolve this issue, refer to [Rook-Ceph](../integrations/rook-ceph.md#file-mount-becomes-unavailable-after-cluster-experiences-network-issues) pack documentation. | April 14, 2024 | Packs, Edge       |
| Edge clusters on Edge hosts with ARM64 processors may experience instability issues that cause cluster failures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | ARM64 support is limited to a specific set of Edge devices. Currently, Nvidia Jetson devices are supported.                                                                                                                                                                    | April 14, 2024 | Edge              |
| During the cluster provisioning process of new edge clusters, the palette webhook pods may not always deploy successfully, causing the cluster to be stuck in the provisioning phase. This issue does not impact deployed clusters.                                                                                                                 | Review the [Palette Webhook Pods Fail to Start](../troubleshooting/edge.md#scenario---palette-webhook-pods-fail-to-start) troubleshooting guide for resolution steps.                                                                                                          | April 14, 2024 | Edge              |
| At this time, [MicroK8s](../integrations/microk8s.md) does not support multi-node control plane clusters. Therefore, the `InPlaceUpgrade` strategy is the only one available for use.                                                                                                                                                               | No workaround is available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | June 1, 2024   | Packs             |
| In clusters using [MicroK8s](../integrations/microk8s.md) as the Kubernetes distribution, the control plane node fails to upgrade when using the `InPlaceUpgrade` strategy for sequential upgrades, such as upgrading from version 1.25.x to version 1.26.x and then to version 1.27.x.                                                             | Refer to the [Control Plane Node Fails to Upgrade in Sequential MicroK8s Upgrades](../troubleshooting/pack-issues.md) troubleshooting guide for resolution steps.                                                                                                              | June 1, 2024   | Packs             |
| In clusters using [MicroK8s](../integrations/microk8s.md) as the Kubernetes distribution, using the `RollingUpgrade` strategy for clusters with less than three control plane nodes may cause the API server to be down during the upgrade, making the cluster inaccessible.                                                                        | A workaround is to deploy clusters with three or more control plane nodes.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | June 1, 2024   | Packs             |
