| After an OS image upgrade in appliance mode, an Edge host may fail to boot into the expected active system image and instead boot into the passive partition as a fallback due to an upgrade failure. When this happens, the Edge host does not automatically rejoin the cluster. The kernel command line (`/proc/cmdline`) includes the `upgrade_failure` flag and confirms the system root is set to `LABEL=COS_PASSIVE`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Recover the Edge host manually using one of the following methods:<br /> - Reboot the host and select **Palette eXtended Kubernetes – Edge** at the GRand Unified Bootloader (GRUB) menu to boot the active image.<br /> - Establish an SSH connection to the host and run `/usr/bin/grub2-editenv /oem/grubenv set next_entry=cos && reboot`. This command updates GRUB to use the boot entry labeled `cos` (the active image) and reboots the host.                                                                                                                                                            | August 28, 2025    | Edge                         |
| On Azure IaaS clusters created using a Palette version prior to 4.6.32, scaling worker node pools does not attach newly created nodes to an outbound load balancer after upgrading to Palette version 4.6.32 or later and the cluster's Palette Agent version to 4.6.7 or later. This impacts outbound connectivity and may also disassociate existing NAT gateways from the worker node pool subnet, resulting in a loss of egress connectivity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | - **Multi-Tenant SaaS** - No workaround available. <br /> - **Self-Hosted Palette or VerteX** - Before upgrading your [self-hosted Palette](../enterprise-version/enterprise-version.md) or [VerteX](../vertex/vertex.md) instance to Palette version 4.6.32 or later, [pause agent upgrades](../clusters/cluster-management/platform-settings/pause-platform-upgrades.md) on any Azure IaaS clusters where you plan to perform Day-2 scaling or repave operations.                                                                                                                                              | August 28, 2025    | Clusters, Self-Hosted        |
| In self-hosted [Palette](../enterprise-version/install-palette/palette-management-appliance.md) and [Vertex Management Appliance](../vertex/install-palette-vertex/vertex-management-appliance.md) environments, uploading the same pack as both a FIPS and non-FIPS version to the same registry overwrites the original pack.<br /><br /> For example, if you have a non-FIPS version of the `byoi-2.1.0` pack in your Zot registry and you upload the FIPS version of `byoi-2.1.0`, the new version will overwrite the existing one. This results in a SHA mismatch between the pack stored in the registry and the pack referenced in the cluster profile, which can lead to cluster creation failures. | Upload either a FIPS or non-FIPS version of a pack to your registry. Do not upload both to the same registry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | August 18, 2025    | Clusters, Self-Hosted        |
| Cilium may fail to start on MAAS machines that are configured with a `br0` interface and are part of a <VersionedLink text="Canonical Kubernetes" url="/integrations/packs/?pack=kubernetes-ck8s" /> cluster, displaying errors like `daemon creation failed: failed to detect devices: unable to determine direct routing device. Use --direct-routing-device to specify it`. This happens because Canonical Kubernetes supports setting various Cilium annotations, but it lacks some fields required for the MAAS `br0` network configuration due to [a limitation in `k8s-snap`](https://github.com/canonical/k8s-snap/issues/1740).                                                                    | Avoid using MAAS machines with a `br0` interface when provisioning Canonical Kubernetes clusters.

This causes the Kubernetes API server to reject Spectro Proxy certificates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Use the CLI flag [`--insecure-skip-tls-verify`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/) with kubectl commands or use the [admin kubeconfig file](../clusters/cluster-management/kubeconfig.md#kubeconfig-files) to access the cluster API, as it does not use the Spectro Proxy server. This option may be limited to environments where you can access the cluster directly from a network perspective.                                                                                                                                                                                          | October 1, 2024    | Clusters, Pack               |

This [issue](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/issues/2693) stems from [Kairos](https://kairos.io/) not passing through the `--allow-discards` flag to the `systemd-cryptsetup attach` command.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Check out the [Degraded Performance on Disk Drives](../troubleshooting/edge/edge.md#scenario---degraded-performance-on-disk-drives) troubleshooting guide for guidance on workaround.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | September 4, 2024  | Edge                         |
| The AWS CSI pack has a [Pod Disruption Budget](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/) (PDB) that allows for a maximum of one unavailable pod. This behavior causes an issue for single-node clusters as well as clusters with a single control plane node and a single worker node where the control plane lacks worker capability. [Operating System (OS) patch](../clusters/cluster-management/os-patching.md) updates may attempt to evict the CSI controller without success, resulting in the node remaining in the un-schedulable state.                                                                                                                                    | If OS patching is enabled, allow the control plane nodes to have worker capability.

| When provisioning an Edge cluster, it's possible that some Operating System (OS) user credentials will be lost once the cluster is active. This is because the cloud-init stages from different sources merge during the deployment process, and sometimes, the same stages without distinct names overwrite each other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Give each of your cloud-init stages in the OS pack and in the Edge installer **user-data** file a unique name. For more information about cloud-init stages and examples of cloud-init stages with names, refer to [Cloud-init Stages](../clusters/edge/edge-configuration/cloud-init.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | July 17, 2024      | Edge                         |
| When you use a content bundle to provision a new cluster without using the local Harbor registry, it's possible for the images to be pulled from external networks instead of from the content bundle, consuming network bandwidth. If your Edge host has no connection to external networks or if it cannot locate the image on a remote registry, some pods may enter the `ImagePullBackOff` state at first, but eventually the pods will be created using images from the content bundle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | For connected clusters, you can make sure that the remote images are not reachable by the Edge host, which will stop the Palette agent from downloading the image and consuming bandwidth, and eventually the cluster will be created using images from the content bundle. For airgap clusters, the `ImagePullBackOff` error will eventually resolve on its own and there is no action to take.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | July 11, 2024      | Edge                         |

| Deploying self-hosted Palette or VerteX to a vSphere environment fails if vCenter has standalone hosts directly under a data center. Persistent Volume (PV) provisioning fails due to an upstream issue with the vSphere Container Storage Interface (CSI) for all versions before v3.2.0. Palette and VerteX use the vSphere CSI version 3.1.2 internally. The issue may also occur in workload clusters deployed on vSphere using the same vSphere CSI for storage volume provisioning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | If you encounter the following error message when deploying self-hosted Palette or VerteX: `'ProvisioningFailed failed to provision volume with StorageClass "spectro-storage-class". Error: failed to fetch hosts from entity ComputeResource:domain-xyz` then use the following workaround. Remove standalone hosts directly under the data center from vCenter and allow the volume provisioning to complete. After the volume is provisioned, you can add the standalone hosts back. You can also use a service account that does not have access to the standalone hosts as the user that deployed Palette. | May 21, 2024       | Self-Hosted                  |

Specifically, Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) will experience start problems due to the lack of a unique cluster ID.                                                                                                                                               | April 14, 2024     | Self-Hosted         | 4.4.14      |

| Deploying self-hosted Palette or VerteX to a vSphere environment fails if vCenter has standalone hosts directly under a data center. Persistent Volume (PV) provisioning fails due to an upstream issue with the vSphere Container Storage Interface (CSI) for all versions before v3.2.0. Palette and VerteX use the vSphere CSI version 3.1.2 internally. The issue may also occur in workload clusters deployed on vSphere using the same vSphere CSI for storage volume provisioning.         | July 20, 2024      | Self-Hosted         | 4.4.11      |
| When you upgrade VerteX from version 4.3.x to 4.4.x, a few system pods may remain unhealthy and experience _CrashLoopBackOff_ errors. This issue only impacts VMware vSphere-based installations and occurs because the internal Mongo DNS is incorrectly configured in the `configserver` ConfigMap.                                                                                                                                                                                             | June 29, 2024      | Self-Hosted, VerteX | 4.4.7       |
