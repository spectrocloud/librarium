Agent mode hosts install and manage their Operating System (OS) outside Palette. This approach brings great flexibility
in terms of architecture, but it has the drawback that Palette cannot upgrade, patch or manage the operating systems of
the hosts. This can lead to inconsistencies, missed updates, or operational risks.

This page demonstrates how to configure regularly scheduled OS upgrades by leveraging cluster profiles. You will learn
how to create your own Kubernetes manifest containing your custom OS upgrade script. Your cluster nodes will then be
selected based on configured node labels and upgraded periodically according to a cron schedule you choose.

## Prerequisites

- A Palette cluster deployed on one or multiple hosts with the Palette Agent installed. Refer to the
  [Install Agent Mode](../install-agent-host.md) guide for further details. The cluster should be listed as **Healthy**
  and with a **Running** status.
  - The host must have access to the internet and a connection to Palette.
- Access to a terminal with network access to your cluster.
- Kubectl installed locally. Refer to the Kubernetes [Install Tools](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) guide for
  further details.

## Enablement

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com).

2. Navigate to the **left Main Menu** and select **Clusters**.

3. Select your cluster to access the cluster details page.

4. Download the **kubeconfig** file for your cluster. Open a terminal and navigate to the location of the file.

5. Set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to the file path of the **kubeconfig** file to enable you to connect to it
   using [kubectl CLI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/). Refer to the
   [Access Cluster with CLI](../../../clusters/cluster-management/palette-webctl.md#access-cluster-with-cli) section for
   further guidance.

   ```shell
   export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/your/kubeconfig
   ```

6. Execute the following commands to find the `spectro-task-XXX` namespace of your cluster and save it to the
   `SYSTEM_UPGRADE_NAMESPACE` variable. This namespace will be different between clusters.

   ```shell
   export SYSTEM_UPGRADE_NAMESPACE=$(kubectl get namespaces --no-headers --output custom-columns=":metadata.name" | grep '^spectro-task')
   echo $SYSTEM_UPGRADE_NAMESPACE
   ```

   The output will be similar to the following snippet.

   ```shell hideClipboard
   spectro-task-6851ddd04b1b188784c06291
   ```

7. Provide an upgrade frequency using a cron format. This is used to configure a Kubernetes
   [CronJob](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/) to execute upgrades on a repeating
   schedule. You can find some common examples of cron schedules in the following table.

   | **Expression** | **Description**                                        |
   | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
   | `0 0 1 1 *`    | Once a year at midnight of 1 January                   |
   | `0 0 1 * *`    | Once a month at midnight of the first day of the month |
   | `0 0 * * 0`    | Once a week at midnight on Sunday morning              |
   | `0 0 * * *`    | Once a day at midnight                                 |
   | `0 * * * *`    | Once an hour at the beginning of the hour              |

   Execute the following command in your terminal, replacing the placeholder with your preferred cron schedule. The
   command saves your chosen schedule to the `SYSTEM_UPGRADE_SCHEDULE` variable.

   ```shell
   export SYSTEM_UPGRADE_SCHEDULE="REPLACE ME"
   ```

8. Execute the following command in your terminal, replacing the placeholder with a node label of your choice. This
   variable allows you to customize which nodes should be periodically updated. The command saves your label to the
   `SYSTEM_UPGRADE_NODE_LABEL` variable.

   ```shell
   export SYSTEM_UPGRADE_NODE_LABEL="REPLACE ME"
   ```

9. Apply the node label to all the nodes that you want updated. Execute the command by replacing the placeholder with
   the name of the node. Repeat this step for each node you want to upgrade.

   ```shell
   kubectl label node REPLACE-ME $SYSTEM_UPGRADE_NODE_LABEL=
   ```

   :::info

   Nodes are drained, upgraded, and rebooted one by one. Ensure that your cluster has enough resources to perform
   rolling upgrades in order to avoid outages.

   :::

10. Save your upgrade scripts to a file titled `upgrades.sh`. You can provide any instructions that you want to execute
    on system upgrade and reboot. The following example provides upgrade instructions for Ubuntu, but you can modify
    them to work according to your host operating system. The command creates the `upgrades.sh` file in your local
    directory.

    ```shell
    cat << 'EOF' > upgrades.sh
    #!/bin/sh
    set -e
    secrets=$(dirname "$0")
    export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
    apt-get --assume-yes update
    apt-get -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-confold" dist-upgrade -q -y --force-yes
    EOF
    ```

11. Execute the following commands to create the `upgrades.yaml` file using your namespace, upgrade schedule, labels,
    and upgrade script variables.

    ```shell
    cat << EOF > upgrades.yaml

    The command creates the `upgrades.yaml` file in your current directory. The YAML file defines the following
    Kubernetes resources.

    | **Resource** | **Name**            | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                         |
    | ------------ | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `Secret`     | `os-upgrade-script` | Stores the `upgrade.sh` shell script, which defines the upgrade logic to be executed on target nodes. This script is later mounted into the container via a secret volume.              |
    | `Secret`     | `os-upgrade-plan`   | Stores the YAML definition of a `SpectroSystemTask` resource in its `plan.yaml` field. The CronJob retrieves this secret and applies the embedded plan to initiate the upgrade process. |
    | `CronJob`    | `os-upgrade-job`    | Schedules the upgrade plan to execute at regular intervals and provides a restart policy should the plan fail.                                                                          |

12. Navigate back to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com) in your browser. Select **Profiles** from the left
    **Main Menu**.

13. Select the cluster profile corresponding to your agent mode cluster.

14. Click on the version **drop-down Menu**. Select the **Create new version** option. Fill in the **Version** input and
    click **Confirm** to create a new version of your cluster profile. The new profile version opens.

15. Click **Add manifest**. The manifest editor appears. Fill in the **Layer name** input field. Then, click **New
    Manifest**. Input a name for the manifest file. Click on the check or press Enter to open the editor.

16. Paste the contents of the `upgrades.yaml` file that you have created in **Step 11**. Click **Confirm Updates** to
    save your manifest. Then, click **Save Changes** to save your manifest to the cluster profile.

17. Navigate to the left **Main Menu** and select **Clusters**.

18. Select your cluster to access the cluster details page.

19. Click on the **Profiles** tab.

20. Select the newly created version of your cluster profile. Click **Save**.

Palette applies your manifest to the cluster. The Kubernetes resources responsible for the system upgrade are created in
the `spectro-task-xxx` namespace.

## Validate

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com).

2. Navigate to the **left Main Menu** and select **Clusters**.

3. Select your cluster to access the cluster details page.

4. Download the **kubeconfig** file for your cluster. Open a terminal and navigate to the location of the file.

5. Set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to the file path of the **kubeconfig** file to enable you to connect to it
   using [kubectl CLI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/). Refer to the
   [Access Cluster with CLI](../../../clusters/cluster-management/palette-webctl.md#access-cluster-with-cli) section for
   further guidance.

   ```shell
   export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/your/kubeconfig
   ```

6. Execute the following commands to find the `spectro-task-XXX` namespace of your cluster and save it to the
   `SYSTEM_UPGRADE_NAMESPACE` variable. This namespace will be different between clusters.

   ```shell
   export SYSTEM_UPGRADE_NAMESPACE=$(kubectl get namespaces --no-headers --output custom-columns=":metadata.name" | grep '^spectro-task')
   echo $SYSTEM_UPGRADE_NAMESPACE
   ```

   The output will be similar to the following snippet.

   ```shell hideClipboard
   spectro-task-6851ddd04b1b188784c06291
   ```

7. Issue the following command to retrieve a list of secrets and cronjobs under the `spectro-task-xxxxx` namespace.

   ```bash
   kubectl get secret,cronjob --namespace $SYSTEM_UPGRADE_NAMESPACE
   ```

   Confirm the secrets `secret/os-upgrade-plan`, `secret/os-upgrade-script` and the `cronjob.batch/os-upgrade-cronjob`
   cron job were created successfully.
