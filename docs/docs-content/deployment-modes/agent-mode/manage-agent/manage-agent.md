This section provides guidance on how to manage hosts deployed in agent mode. Hosts deployed in agent mode have access
to Local UI unless you disable it in your installer configuration user data. Refer to
[Access Local UI](../../../clusters/edge/local-ui/host-management/access-console.md) to learn how to access Local UI.

Review the following resource to learn more about customizing the
[Local UI](../../../clusters/edge/local-ui/local-ui.md) web interface, which you can use to configure and manage your
host. You may also review the [Local UI section](../../../clusters/edge/local-ui/local-ui.md) to learn more about the
host management features that Local UI has to offer.
