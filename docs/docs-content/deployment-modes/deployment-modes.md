Real-life applications in Kubernetes can operate in many different environments, with varying security, compliance, and
performance requirements.

Palette offers three different deployment modes that can help you meet the needs of your organization. Whether you want
to operate your cluster in public cloud, private data centers, or at the Edge, whether you want to use your own
organization's hardware and Operating Systems (OS) or build secure immutable OS to bootstrap your applications, you can
choose a solution that works for you.

To provision a Kubernetes cluster, you can choose from the following deployment modes.

- Controller mode.
- Agent mode.
- Appliance mode.
