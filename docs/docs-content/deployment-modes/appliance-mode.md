In appliance mode, you bring your own host, which can be any host that meets the basic hardware requirements regardless
of environmentsï¼Œ including an EC2 instance on AWS or an Edge host in your own home. Unlike agent mode, instead of
bringing Operating Systems (OS) from your organization, you would build secure, immutable images that combine the OS and
the Kubernetes distribution for your host.
