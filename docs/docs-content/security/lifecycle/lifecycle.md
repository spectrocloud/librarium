Our proactive shift left approach to making security an integral part of our development process ensures we detect and
address vulnerabilities and design flaws early in the development cycle. By integrating security into every stage of the
development lifecycle, we improve our software quality and reduce vulnerabilities while minimizing manual intervention
and potential human error.

![Secure development flow from feature definition and design to development and release](/security_dev_lifecycle.webp)

Our Security team is involved early in the design process and identifies real and potential issues, which are logged in
a ticketing system. Throughout development and before release we conduct subsequent reviews and automated scans for
common vulnerabilities. Scans go beyond our own code to include third-party libraries and container images. We list any
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) issues on our
[Security Bulletins](../../security-bulletins/security-bulletins.md) along with the fix applied and any workarounds.
