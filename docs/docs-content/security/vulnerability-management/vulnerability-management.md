Our proactive and comprehensive vulnerability management program includes continuously monitoring, identifying,
communicating, and remediating vulnerabilities in our products, including vulnerabilities that originate in third-party
components or open source components.

Each stage of our vulnerability management program is designed to foster a culture of security resilience. The following
table provides a summary of the activities that comprise each stage.

| **Stage**      | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Identification | Detecting vulnerabilities through regular 24/7 monitoring, external penetration testing, weekly and daily vulnerability scans, and our Bug Bounty Program.                                                                                                        |
| Prioritization | We rely on NIST CVE severity as the most authoritative data for open source and third-party product vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities found in our core products are prioritized based on criteria and our internal testing.                                       |
| Assessment     | We rely on NIST CVE severity where applicable. Where not applicable, we use a risk-based approach to assessing vulnerabilities and consider the exploitability, impact on business continuity, and/or how the software is sourced, built, packaged, and deployed. |
| Communication  | Security advisories are published for all critical and high vulnerabilities after they are discovered, prioritized, and assessed. Refer to [Security Bulletins](../../security-bulletins/security-bulletins.md) for further information.                          |
| Remediation    | Developed fixes are applied as soon as practical. Third-party component remediations may be delayed depending on the availability of upstream fixes.                                                                                                              |
| Verification   | Once the remediation has been completed, thorough testing is done to ensure the fixes are effective. Customers may need to upgrade their existing clusters to inherit vulnerability fixes.                                                                        |

:::info

Like most other cloud native products, our products depend on many open source libraries and third-party components.
Often there are external dependencies on open source communities and third-party vendors in addressing these
vulnerabilities. Where applicable and appropriate, we will include workarounds in the security advisories.
