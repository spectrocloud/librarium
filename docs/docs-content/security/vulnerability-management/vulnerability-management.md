## Spectro Cloud Vulnerability Management

Our proactive and comprehensive approach to vulnerability management program includes continuously monitoring, identifying, communicating, and remediating vulnerabilities in our products, including vulnerabilities that originate in third-party components or open-source components.

Each stage of our vulnerability management program is designed to foster a culture of security resilience. Here's why each stage is important:

1.  Identification
    - Detecting vulnerabilities through regular 24/7 monitoring, external penetration testing, weekly and daily vulnerability scans, and our Bug Bounty Program.
2.  Prioritization 
    - We rely on NIST CVE severity as the most authoritative data for open source and third-party product vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities found in our core products are prioritized based on criteria and our internal testing. 
3.  Assessment
    - We rely on NIST CVE severity where applicable. Where not applicable, we use a risk-based approach to assessing vulnerabilities and factor in characteristics such as how the software is sourced, built, packaged, and deployed. 
4.  Communication
    - Security advisories are published for all critical and high vulnerabilities after they are discovered, prioritized, and assessed. See our advisory page [here](../../security-bulletins/security-bulletins.md). 
5.  Remediation 
    - Developed fixes are applied as soon as practical Third-party component remediations may be delayed depending on the availability of upstream fixes. 
6.  Verification
    - Once the remediation has been completed, thorough testing is done to ensure the fixes are effective. Customers may need to upgrade their existing clusters to inherit vulnerability fixes. 

## Dependencies
Like most other cloud native products, our products depend on many open-source libraries and third-party components. Often there are external dependencies on open-source communities and third-party vendors in addressing these vulnerabilities. Where applicable and appropriate, we will include workarounds in the security advisories.
