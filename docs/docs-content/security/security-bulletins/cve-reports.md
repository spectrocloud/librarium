## October 11, 2023 - CVE-2023-44487 HTTP/2 Denial of Service - 7.5 CVSS

The HTTP/2 protocol may be used to create a denial of service and cause a server to exhaust all of its allocated resources. A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and
immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption.

#### Impact

All Palette and VerteX releases prior to version 4.1.0 are impacted. The impact is largely mitigated as Palette and VerteX already have IP address based rate limit.

#### Patches
Palette and Vertex version 4.1.0 includes the fix for all the services using HTTP/2 protocol.

### Workarounds
No workaround available. Impact is largely mitigated by the rate limits on the API requests. Refer to the [API Rate Limit](/api/introduction#rate-limits) documentation for more information.

## October 17, 2023 - CVE-2023-4911 Buffer Overflow in Dynamic Loader - 7.8 CVSS

A buffer overflow was discovered in the GNU C Libraryâ€™s dynamic loader `ld.so` while processing the `GLIBC_TUNABLES` environment variable. This issue could allow a local attacker to use maliciously crafted `GLIBC_TUNABLES` environment variables when launching binaries with `SUID`` permission to execute code with elevated privileges.

#### Impact

All internal Palette and VerteX microservices are not impacted as the binaries are compiled using [musl](https://musl.libc.org). This vulnerability, from an OS perspective, cannot be exploited without a remote code execution exploit.


#### Patches

Release 4.1.0 include the security patch for the vulnerability.

#### Workarounds


Self-hosted instances of Palette and VerteX need to upgrade to version 4.1.0 or greater. Tenant Clusters and Private Cloud Gateways can be patched using the on-demand or scheduled OS security patches apply feature. Refer to the [OS Patching](../../clusters/cluster-management/os-patching.md) documentation for more information.

## September 25, 2023 - CVE-2023-4863 Libwebp Programs Terminations - 8.8 CVSS

A heap buffer overflow in the library, `libwebp`, allows a remote attacker to perform an out of bounds memory write via a crafted HTML page. This vulerability is present with the combination of Google Chrome prior to versions 116.0.5845.187 with `libwebp` version 1.3.2. This is Chromium security severity that is marked as Critical.

#### Impact
No impact since `libwebp` is not used on any of the Palette container images. This vulnerability, from an OS perspective OS, a cannot be exploited without a remote code execution exploit.

#### Patches

Release 4.1.0 of self-hosted Palette and VerteX deployment include the security patch for the CVE.

#### Workarounds
Self-hosted instances of Palette and VerteX need to upgrade to version 4.1.0 or greater.

## September 01, 2023 - CVE-2023-22809 Sudo Vulnerability - 7.8 CVSS

The sudo program version 1.9.12p2 and earlier mishandles extra arguments passed in the user-provided environment variables `SUDO_EDITOR`, `VISUAL`, and `EDITOR` when the `sudoedit` command is executed. 

The mishandling allows a local attacker to append arbitrary entries to the list of files to process. This can lead to privilege escalation. Affected versions are 1.8.0 through 1.9.12.p1. The problem exists because a user-specified editor may contain the `--` argument that defeats a protection mechanism. For example, an attacker may issue the following command `EDITOR='vim -- /path/to/extra/file` value.


### Impact


This vulnerability affects the following Palette components:

- Self-hosted Palette instances with versions older than 4.0.0


- Private Cloud Gateways instances with versions older than 4.0.0


- Clusters deployed with Palette versions older than 4.0.0


### Patches

For self-hosted Palette environments, upgrade to Palette version 4.0.0 or greater. Upgrading Palette will automatically update the OS.


### Workarounds

For clusters and Private Cloud Gateways, patch the OS. You can use the on-demand or scheduled features to apply the OS security patches. Refer to the [OS Patching](../../clusters/cluster-management/os-patching.md) documentation for more information.

## September 01, 2023 - CVE-2023-38408 OpenSSH Vulnerability - 9.8 CVSS


The PKCS#11 feature in the OpenSSH ssh-agent before version 9.3p2 has an insufficiently trustworthy search path. This may lead to remote code execution if an agent is forwarded to an attacker-controlled system. Code in the folder **/usr/lib** may be unsafe to load into the ssh-agent. This issue exists because of an incomplete fix for [CVE-2016-10009](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2016-10009).



### Impact

This vulnerability affects the following Palette components:

- Self-hosted Palette instances with versions older than 4.0.0


- Private Cloud Gateways instances with versions older than 4.0.0


- Clusters deployed with Palette versions older than 4.0.0



### Patches

- For self-hosted Palette environments, upgrade to Palette version 4.0.0 or greater. Upgrading Palette will automatically update the Operating System (OS).



### Workarounds

- For clusters and Private Cloud Gateways, patch the OS. You can use the on-demand or scheduled features to apply the OS security patches. Refer to the [OS Patching](../../clusters/cluster-management/os-patching.md) documentation for more information.

## September 01, 2023 - CVE-2023-24538 - HTML Template Vulnerability - Security Advisory - 9.8 CVSS

Go templates do not consider backticks as a Javascript string delimiter and, as a result, do not escape them as expected. Backticks have been used since ES6 for JS template literals. If a Go template contains an action within a literal Javascript template, the action's contents can be used to terminate the literal and potentially inject arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template.

Go template actions are disallowed from being used inside of them, for example, `"var a = {{.}}"` since there is no safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With this fix, `Template.Parse()` returns an error when it encounters templates containing actions with literal JavaScript. The ErrorCode has a value of 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21. Users who rely on the previous behavior can re-enable it using the `GODEBUG flag jstmpllitinterp=1` with the caveat that backticks will now be escaped.



### Impact

No impact. We use the Go package [html/template](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template) and our HTML templates are static. We also do not accept or parse any provided user data.

## September 01, 2023 - CVE-2023-29402 - Go get Vulnerability Security Advisory - 9.8 CVSS

The go command may execute arbitrary code at build time when using cgo. The arbitrary code execution may occur when the command `go get` is issued on a malicious module or when using any other command that builds untrusted code. This can be triggered by linker flags specified via a `#cgo LDFLAGS directive`. Flags containing embedded spaces are mishandled, and disallowed flags are smuggled through the LDFLAGS sanitization by including them in the argument of another flag. This only affects the gccgo compiler.

## March 20, 2023 - CVE-2023-22809 Sudo Vulnerability in Palette - 7.8 CVSS

A security vulnerability in `sudo -e` option (aka *sudoedit*) allows a malicious user with sudoedit privileges to edit arbitrary files. The Palette container `palette-controller-manager:mold-manager` incorporates a sudo version affected by sudoers policy bypass in sudo when using sudoedit.

All versions of Palette before  v2.6.70 are affected.



#### Impact

A local user with permission to edit files can use this flaw to change a file not permitted by the security policy, resulting in privilege escalation.


#### Resolution

* For Palette SaaS, this has been addressed and requires no user action. 
* For â€‹â€‹Palette self-hosted deployments, please upgrade to newer versions greater than or equal to  v2.6.70 to address the reported vulnerability.
  

#### Workarounds

None.

## August 4, 2022 - CVE-2022-1292 c_rehash script vulnerability in vSphere CSI pack - 9.8 CVSS

On May 3 2022, OpenSSL published a security advisory disclosing a command injection vulnerability in the `c_rehash` script included with the OpenSSL library. Some operating systems automatically execute this script as a part of normal operations, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.

Palette is not directly affected by this vulnerability. However, if your cluster profile is using the vSphere CSI pack, version v2.3 or below, it contains a vulnerable version of the `c_rehash` script.


#### Impact

The `c_rehash` script does not sanitize shell metacharacters properly to prevent command injection. This script is distributed by some operating systems, and by extension, in container images, in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script.

#### Resolution

This vulnerability has been addressed in the vSphere CSI pack greater than or equal to version v2.6.

#### Workarounds

Update cluster profiles using the vSphere CSI pack to version v2.6 or greater. Apply the updated cluster profile changes to all clusters consuming the cluster profile.
