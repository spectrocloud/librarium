## January 10, 2024 - CVE-2023-39323 Line directives ("//line") can be used to bypass the restrictions on "//go:cgo_" directives - 8.1 CVSS

Line directives ("//line") can be used to bypass the restrictions on "//go:cgo_" directives, allowing blocked linker and compiler flags to be passed during compilation. This can result in unexpected execution of arbitrary code when running "go build". The line directive requires the absolute path of the file in which the directive lives, which makes exploiting this issue significantly more complex.

## January 10, 2024 - CVE-2023-45283 The filepath package does not recognize paths with a \??\ prefix as special - 7.5 CVSS

The filepath package does not recognize paths with a \??\ prefix as special. On Windows, a path beginning with \??\ is a Root Local Device path equivalent to a path beginning with \\?\. Paths with a \??\ prefix may be used to access arbitrary locations on the system. For example, the path \??\c:\x is equivalent to the more common path c:\x. Before fix, Clean could convert a rooted path such as \a\..\??\b into the root local device path \??\b. Clean will now convert this to .\??\b. Similarly, Join(\, ??, b) could convert a seemingly innocent sequence of path elements into the root local device path \??\b. Join will now convert this to \.\??\b. In addition, with fix, IsAbs now correctly reports paths beginning with \??\ as absolute, and VolumeName correctly reports the \??\ prefix as a volume name. UPDATE: Go 1.20.11 and Go 1.21.4 inadvertently changed the definition of the volume name in Windows paths starting with \?, resulting in filepath.Clean(\?\c:) returning \?\c: rather than \?\c:\ (among other effects). The previous behavior has been restored.

## January 10, 2024 - CVE-2023-45285 Using go get to fetch a module with the ".git" suffix may unexpectedly fallback to the insecure "git://" protocol - 7.5 CVSS

Using go get to fetch a module with the ".git" suffix may unexpectedly fallback to the insecure "git://" protocol if the module is unavailable via the secure "https://" and "git+ssh://" protocols, even if GOINSECURE is not set for said module. This only affects users who are not using the module proxy and are fetching modules directly (i.e. GOPROXY=off).

## January 10, 2024 - CVE-2023-39325 Excessive Server Resource Consumption - 7.5 CVSS

A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.

## October 17, 2023 - CVE-2023-4911 Buffer Overflow in Dynamic Loader - 7.8 CVSS

A buffer overflow was discovered in the GNU C Library’s dynamic loader `ld.so` while processing the `GLIBC_TUNABLES` environment variable. This issue could allow a local attacker to use maliciously crafted `GLIBC_TUNABLES` environment variables when launching binaries with `SUID`` permission to execute code with elevated privileges.

#### Impact

All internal Palette and VerteX microservices are not impacted as the binaries are compiled using [musl](https://musl.libc.org). This vulnerability, from an OS perspective, cannot be exploited without a remote code execution exploit.


#### Patches

Release 4.1.0 include the security patch for the vulnerability.

#### Workarounds


Self-hosted instances of Palette and VerteX need to upgrade to version 4.1.0 or greater. Tenant Clusters and Private Cloud Gateways can be patched using the on-demand or scheduled OS security patches apply feature. Refer to the [OS Patching](../../clusters/cluster-management/os-patching.md) documentation for more information.

## October 11, 2023 - CVE-2023-44487 HTTP/2 Denial of Service - 7.5 CVSS

The HTTP/2 protocol may be used to create a denial of service and cause a server to exhaust all of its allocated resources. A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and
immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption.

#### Impact

All Palette and VerteX releases prior to version 4.1.0 are impacted. The impact is largely mitigated as Palette and VerteX already have IP address based rate limit.

#### Patches
Palette and Vertex version 4.1.0 includes the fix for all the services using HTTP/2 protocol.

### Workarounds
No workaround available. Impact is largely mitigated by the rate limits on the API requests. Refer to the [API Rate Limit](/api/introduction#rate-limits) documentation for more information.

## September 25, 2023 - CVE-2023-4863 Libwebp Programs Terminations - 8.8 CVSS

A heap buffer overflow in the library, `libwebp`, allows a remote attacker to perform an out of bounds memory write via a crafted HTML page. This vulerability is present with the combination of Google Chrome prior to versions 116.0.5845.187 with `libwebp` version 1.3.2. This is Chromium security severity that is marked as Critical.

#### Impact
No impact since `libwebp` is not used on any of the Palette container images. This vulnerability, from an OS perspective OS, a cannot be exploited without a remote code execution exploit.

#### Patches

Release 4.1.0 of self-hosted Palette and VerteX deployment include the security patch for the CVE.

#### Workarounds
Self-hosted instances of Palette and VerteX need to upgrade to version 4.1.0 or greater.

## September 01, 2023 - CVE-2023-22809 Sudo Vulnerability - 7.8 CVSS

The sudo program version 1.9.12p2 and earlier mishandles extra arguments passed in the user-provided environment variables `SUDO_EDITOR`, `VISUAL`, and `EDITOR` when the `sudoedit` command is executed. 

The mishandling allows a local attacker to append arbitrary entries to the list of files to process. This can lead to privilege escalation. Affected versions are 1.8.0 through 1.9.12.p1. The problem exists because a user-specified editor may contain the `--` argument that defeats a protection mechanism. For example, an attacker may issue the following command `EDITOR='vim -- /path/to/extra/file` value.


### Impact


This vulnerability affects the following Palette components:

- Self-hosted Palette instances with versions older than 4.0.0


- Private Cloud Gateways instances with versions older than 4.0.0


- Clusters deployed with Palette versions older than 4.0.0


### Patches

For self-hosted Palette environments, upgrade to Palette version 4.0.0 or greater. Upgrading Palette will automatically update the OS.


### Workarounds

For clusters and Private Cloud Gateways, patch the OS. You can use the on-demand or scheduled features to apply the OS security patches. Refer to the [OS Patching](../../clusters/cluster-management/os-patching.md) documentation for more information.

## September 01, 2023 - CVE-2023-24538 - HTML Template Vulnerability - Security Advisory - 9.8 CVSS

Go templates do not consider backticks as a Javascript string delimiter and, as a result, do not escape them as expected. Backticks have been used since ES6 for JS template literals. If a Go template contains an action within a literal Javascript template, the action's contents can be used to terminate the literal and potentially inject arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template.

Go template actions are disallowed from being used inside of them, for example, `"var a = {{.}}"` since there is no safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With this fix, `Template.Parse()` returns an error when it encounters templates containing actions with literal JavaScript. The ErrorCode has a value of 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21. Users who rely on the previous behavior can re-enable it using the `GODEBUG flag jstmpllitinterp=1` with the caveat that backticks will now be escaped.

## August 4, 2022 - CVE-2022-1292 c_rehash script vulnerability in vSphere CSI pack - 9.8 CVSS

On May 3 2022, OpenSSL published a security advisory disclosing a command injection vulnerability in the `c_rehash` script included with the OpenSSL library. Some operating systems automatically execute this script as a part of normal operations, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.

Palette is not directly affected by this vulnerability. However, if your cluster profile is using the vSphere CSI pack, version v2.3 or below, it contains a vulnerable version of the `c_rehash` script.


#### Impact

The `c_rehash` script does not sanitize shell metacharacters properly to prevent command injection. This script is distributed by some operating systems, and by extension, in container images, in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script.

#### Resolution

This vulnerability has been addressed in the vSphere CSI pack greater than or equal to version v2.6.

#### Workarounds

Update cluster profiles using the vSphere CSI pack to version v2.6 or greater. Apply the updated cluster profile changes to all clusters consuming the cluster profile.
