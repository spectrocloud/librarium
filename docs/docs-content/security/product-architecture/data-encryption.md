Palette has security controls for the operating system, containers, and Kubernetes. Data is protected with secure keys,
encryption, and secure communication, standard authentication and authorization, and API security. Audit logs record
actions taken on the platform. Review the [Audit Logs](../../audit-logs/audit-logs.md) guide to learn how to access and
use them.

## Data At Rest Encryption

Tenant data is encrypted using a 64-bit cryptographically secure tenant key. A unique tenant key is generated for each
tenant. The tenant key is encrypted using the system root key and is stored in the database. The system root key is
stored in the cluster’s etcd key-value store. All message communication uses tenant-specific channels.

The following secure keys are unique and generated for each installation:

- **Root Key**: Encrypts the tenant-specific encryption key.

- **JSON Web Token (JWT) signature key**: Used to sign the JWT token.

- **Hash Salt**: Used to hash the user password and email ID.

- **Tenant key**: A 64-bit cryptographically secure tenant key encrypts tenant data stored in the management cluster,
  such as user account name, user email ID, and tenant cloud credentials.

In self-managed deployments, secure keys are generated during installation and stored as secrets in the management
cluster’s etcd key-value store.

## Data In Transit Encryption

Palette secures data in motion using an encrypted Transport Layer Security (TLS) communication channel for all internal
and external interactions.

- **End User Communication**: Public certificates are created using a cert-manager for external API/UI communication. In
  self-hosted deployments, you can import an optional certificate and private key to match the Fully Qualified Domain
  Name (FQDN) management cluster.

- **Inter-Service Communication**: Services in the management cluster communicate over HTTPS with self-signed
  certificates and an Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) 2048-bit key.

- **Database Communication**: The database connection between Palette internal services that are active in the
  management cluster and MongoDB is protected by TLS with Authentication enabled.

- **Cluster Communication (gRPC)**: gRPC facilitates secure and efficient communication between the management platform
  and tenant clusters. gRPC connections are encrypted using TLS, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality. Each
  tenant cluster is assigned dedicated credentials to authenticate with the management platform, and strict
  authorization policies enforce message and data isolation across tenants.
