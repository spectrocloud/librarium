### Summary

This advisory outlines security vulnerabilities related to [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx)
and the recommended remediation actions.

The identified CVEs affect all ingress-nginx controller deployments using the vulnerable image versions mentioned in
this advisory. When chained together, the vulnerabilities can enable unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary code and
download confidential information such as secrets available in the cluster. These vulnerable images are used in the
Palette and VerteX management planes. Additionally, Spectro Cloud also provides the Nginx pack to customers for their
workload clusters, which contains several vulnerable image versions.

As of March 26, 2025, all managed Palette instances have been patched. Customers should follow the below procedures to
manually upgrade the affected component in self-hosted Palette and VerteX deployments and use the newly published Nginx
pack (`1.11.5`) to upgrade affected workload clusters. All prior versions of Nginx will be marked deprecated within
Palette.

### Recommended Actions

This vulnerability affects both workload clusters and Palette deployments.

- If you have any workload clusters using the affected version of the Nginx pack, you must update the cluster profile to
  use version `1.11.5` of the Nginx pack. Refer to the
  [Update a Cluster Profile](../../profiles/cluster-profiles/modify-cluster-profiles/update-cluster-profile.md) guide
  for instructions on how to update a cluster profile and apply the updates to workload clusters.

- If you have any self-hosted instances of Palette or VerteX with the affected version of the `ingress-nginx-controller`
  DaemonSet, you must update it to version `1.11.5`. Follow the steps described in the upcoming sections to manually
  upgrade the controller.

#### Multi-Tenant and Dedicated SaaS Palette

As of March 26, 2025, the `ingress-nginx-controller` DaemonSet used for multi-tenant and dedicated SaaS Palette has been
upgraded to version `1.11.5`.

Workload clusters must be identified and updated manually to use version `1.11.5` of the Nginx pack. Follow the below
instructions to upgrade Nginx.

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com).

2. Navigate to the left main menu and select **Clusters**.

3. Select a workload cluster to review. Navigate to the cluster's **Profile** tab and note if the cluster profile being
   used contains Nginx.

4. Repeat step 3 for each cluster to ensure all cluster profiles using Nginx are identified.

5. Update all cluster profiles currently using the affected version of the Nginx pack to `1.11.5`. Refer to the
   [Update a Cluster Profile](../../profiles/cluster-profiles/modify-cluster-profiles/update-cluster-profile.md) guide
   for instructions on how to update a cluster profile.

6. Apply the profile updates to all affected clusters. Refer to the
   [Apply Profile Updates to Clusters](../../profiles/cluster-profiles/modify-cluster-profiles/update-cluster-profile.md#apply-profile-updates-to-clusters)
   guide to learn how to apply profile updates to clusters.

#### Self-Hosted Instances of Palette or VerteX Installed with Helm Charts

If you have any self-hosted instances of Palette or VerteX installed via Helm Charts with the affected version of the
`ingress-nginx-controller` DaemonSet, you must update it to version `1.11.5`. Follow the steps below to download the
updated version of the component and update your instance.

1. Use the `kubeconfig` file and `kubectl` tool to access your self-hosted Palette or VerteX cluster. Refer to the
   [Access Cluster with CLI](../../clusters/cluster-management/palette-webctl.md) guide for more information.

2. Check the image used by the `ingress-nginx-controller` DaemonSet in the `ingress-nginx` namespace.

   ```shell
   kubectl get daemonset ingress-nginx-controller --namespace ingress-nginx --output yaml | grep 'image:'
   ```

3. Once you identify the image, update its tag to `v1.11.5`. You can use the `kubectl set image` command to update the
   image.

- If the `ingress-nginx-controller` DaemonSet is using the image
  `gcr.io/spectro-images-public/release-fips/ingress-nginx/controller:v1.11.2`, update it to
  `gcr.io/spectro-images-public/release-fips/ingress-nginx/controller:v1.11.5`. Replace `<container-name>` with the name
  of the container.

  ```shell
  kubectl set image daemonset/ingress-nginx-controller <container-name>=gcr.io/spectro-images-public/release-fips/ingress-nginx/controller:v1.11.5 --namespace ingress-nginx
  ```

- If the `ingress-nginx-controller` DaemonSet is using the image
  `us-docker.pkg.dev/palette-images/third-party/ingress-nginx/controller:v1.11.2`, update it to
  `us-docker.pkg.dev/palette-images/third-party/ingress-nginx/controller:v1.11.5`. Replace `<container-name>` with the
  name of the container.

  ```shell
  kubectl set image daemonset/ingress-nginx-controller <container-name>=us-docker.pkg.dev/palette-images/third-party/ingress-nginx/controller:v1.11.5 --namespace ingress-nginx
  ```

#### Self-Hosted Instances of Palette or VerteX Installed with the Palette CLI

If you have any self-hosted instances of Palette or VerteX installed via the Palette CLI with the affected version of
the `ingress-nginx-controller` DaemonSet, you must update it to version `1.11.5`. Follow the steps below to download the
updated version of the component and update your instance.

1. Use the `kubeconfig` file and `kubectl` tool to access your self-hosted Palette or VerteX cluster. Refer to the
   [Access Cluster with CLI](../../clusters/cluster-management/palette-webctl.md) guide for more information.

2. Scale down the `palette-controller-manager` deployment to zero replicas in the `cluster-mgmt-*` namespace, replacing
   `*` with the suffix associated with your namespace.

   ```shell
   kubectl scale deployment palette-controller-manager --replicas=0 --namespace cluster-mgmt-*
   ```

3. Scale down the `cluster-management-agent` deployment to zero replicas in the `cluster-mgmt-*` namespace, replacing
   `*` with the suffix associated with your namespace.

   ```shell
   kubectl scale deployment cluster-management-agent --replicas=0 --namespace cluster-mgmt-*
   ```

4. Confirm that both deployments have been scaled down to zero replicas. Replace `*` with the suffix associated with
   your namespace.

   ```shell
   kubectl get deployments --namespace cluster-mgmt-*
   ```

5. Check the image used by the `ingress-nginx-controller` DaemonSet in the `ingress-nginx` namespace.

   ```shell
   kubectl get daemonset ingress-nginx-controller --namespace ingress-nginx --output yaml | grep 'image:'
   ```

6. Once you identify the image, update its tag to `v1.11.5`. You can use the `kubectl set image` command to update the
   image.

- If the `ingress-nginx-controller` DaemonSet is using the image
  `gcr.io/spectro-images-public/release-fips/ingress-nginx/controller:v1.11.2`, update it to
  `gcr.io/spectro-images-public/release-fips/ingress-nginx/controller:v1.11.5`. Replace `<container-name>` with the name
  of the container.

  ```shell
  kubectl set image daemonset/ingress-nginx-controller <container-name>=gcr.io/spectro-images-public/release-fips/ingress-nginx/controller:v1.11.5 --namespace ingress-nginx
  ```

- If the `ingress-nginx-controller` DaemonSet is using the image
  `us-docker.pkg.dev/palette-images/third-party/ingress-nginx/controller:v1.11.2`, update it to
  `us-docker.pkg.dev/palette-images/third-party/ingress-nginx/controller:v1.11.5`. Replace `<container-name>` with the
  name of the container.

  ```shell
  kubectl set image daemonset/ingress-nginx-controller <container-name>=us-docker.pkg.dev/palette-images/third-party/ingress-nginx/controller:v1.11.5 --namespace ingress-nginx
  ```
