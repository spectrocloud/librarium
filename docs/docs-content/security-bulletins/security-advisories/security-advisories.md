## Security Advisory 004 - MongoDB: FIPS Mode Cryptographic Algorithm Use from Non-FIPS Providers

- **Release Date**: September 11, 2025
- **Last Updated**: September 11, 2025
- **Severity**: High
- **Applicable Deployments**: Self-Hosted Palette VerteX

### Summary

On September 11, 2025, Spectro Cloud became aware of a recently disclosed vulnerability related to the use of MongoDB
servers configured for FIPS mode, in which MongoDB incorrectly allows the use of cryptographic algorithms from non-FIPS
providers. This may allow client TLS connections to agree to use (negotiate) non-FIPS-compliant cryptographic algorithms
even when FIPS mode is enabled on MongoDB. As a result, self-hosted Palette VerteX deployments running on a
non-FIPS-compliant OS or Kubernetes cluster may allow negotiation of non-FIPS cryptographic algorithms.

For additional information regarding this advisory, refer to
[MongoDB Jira issue SERVER-109268](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-109268).

### Recommended Actions

By default, Spectro Cloud enforces FIPS-only mode on the MongoDB container. No action is required for self-hosted
Palette VerteX instances installed on a FIPS-compliant OS or Kubernetes cluster, which is a
[prerequisite](../../vertex/install-palette-vertex/install-on-kubernetes/install.md#prerequisites) for FIPS-compliant
Palette VerteX installations. As a result, self-hosted Palette VerteX instances that do _not_ meet the FIPS
prerequisites may be affected by this vulnerability.

Customers should verify their Palette VerteX setup to ensure they are not affected. Affected customers should take the
appropriate actions to secure their environment and meet the FIPS prerequisites.

## Security Advisory 003 - Self-Deleting Nodes with OwnerReference

- **Release Date**: August 14, 2025
- **Last Updated**: August 14, 2025
- **Severity**: Medium (5.4)
- **Affected Versions**: v1.31.0 - v1.31.11, v1.32.0 - v1.32.7, and v1.33.0 - v1.33.3

### Summary

A recently disclosed vulnerability in the `NodeRestriction` admission controller allows node users to delete their own
`Node` object by patching it with an `OwnerReference` to a cluster-scoped resource.

Normally, node users are authorized to create and patch their own `Node` object but not delete it. However, the
`NodeRestriction` controller does not block patches that set `OwnerReferences`, enabling a compromised node to delete
and then recreate its own `Node` object.

This recreation can bypass the usual restrictions on modifying taints or labels, allowing an attacker to change node
scheduling behavior and control which pods run on the compromised node.

This vulnerability affects all clusters using an affected Kubernetes version across all Palette Enterprise and Palette
VerteX releases.

For additional information regarding this advisory, refer to the
[Kubernetes GitHub issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/133471).

### Recommended Actions

:::info

- This workaround will result in a cluster [repave](../../glossary-all.md#repavement).
- This workaround is not applicable for cloud-managed clusters such as EKS, GKE, and AKS. Refer to your cloud provider
  for steps on patching cloud-managed clusters.

:::

In the Kubernetes layer of the [infrastructure cluster profile](../../profiles/profiles.md) for the affected cluster,
enable the `OwnerReferencesPermissionEnforcement` admission controller by adding it to the `enable-admission-plugins`
argument under the `apiServer` section. After saving your changes, make sure to
[update](../../clusters/cluster-management/cluster-updates.md) all affected clusters.

When enabled, this admission controller prevents any user or service account from modifying an objectâ€™s
`OwnerReferences` unless they have delete permission on the owner object (the object referenced in `OwnerReferences`).

### Roadmap

Patch releases for Kubernetes versions 1.31, 1.32, and 1.33 that address this vulnerability will be available in future
Palette Enterprise and Palette VerteX releases. No patches will be available for 1.30 and older versions.

## Security Advisory 002 - Kubernetes Race Condition

This advisory outlines security vulnerabilities related to the use of the `os.RemoveAll` function in Go, which affects
Kubernetes clusters compiled with vulnerable Go versions, as well as the recommended remediation actions.

- **Release Date**: June 18, 2025
- **Last Updated**: June 18, 2025
- **Severity**: High
- **Affected Versions**: Kubernetes versions that were compiled with Go versions earlier than 1.21.11 or 1.22.4
- **Fixed Versions**: v1.27.15+, v1.28.11+, v1.29.6+, and v1.30.2+

### Related CVEs

This advisory has not been assigned a CVE.

### Timeline

- **June 17, 2025**: First notified of vulnerabilities.

### Summary

The identified vulnerability affects Kubernetes versions that were compiled with Go versions earlier than 1.21.11 or
1.22.4. The issue relates to the use of the `os.RemoveAll` function in Go. It involves a symlink race condition that
allows local non-root users (such as a containerized process) with the same UID as the Pod user to delete arbitrary
directories on a host node with root privileges. This issue is especially relevant in environments running multi-tenant
or untrusted workloads, where a compromised workload may pose a broader threat to the host.

All the clusters using an affected Kubernetes version must be updated manually. Users must review their cluster
profiles, workload clusters, and instances of Palette Enterprise or Palette VerteX, and upgrade the Kubernetes version
to a fixed version. The following Kubernetes versions, available in Palette Enterprise or Palette VerteX deployments for
workload cluster provisioning, are vulnerable.

| Palette Version          | Kubernetes Versions                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### Summary

The identified CVEs affect all ingress-nginx controller deployments using the vulnerable image versions mentioned in
this advisory. When chained together, the vulnerabilities can enable unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary code and
download confidential information such as secrets available in the cluster. These vulnerable images are used in the
Palette and VerteX management planes. Additionally, Spectro Cloud also provides the Nginx pack to customers for their
workload clusters, which contains several vulnerable image versions.

As of April 4, 2025, all vulnerable Nginx packs have been deprecated, all managed Palette instances have been patched,
and patches are available for connected and airgapped Palette Enterprise and VerteX versions 4.4 - 4.6.

All workload clusters across all Palette and VerteX installations must be updated manually. All users should review
their cluster profiles and workload clusters and upgrade the Nginx pack to version `1.11.5`.

### Recommended Actions

This vulnerability affects both workload clusters and Palette deployments.

- If you have any workload clusters using the affected version of the Nginx pack, you must update the cluster profile to
  use version `1.11.5` of the Nginx pack. Refer to the
  [Update a Cluster Profile](../../profiles/cluster-profiles/modify-cluster-profiles/update-cluster-profile.md) guide
  for instructions on how to update a cluster profile and apply the updates to workload clusters.

- Connected and airgapped Palette Enterprise and VerteX versions 4.4 - 4.6 must apply the latest patch to automatically
  upgrade the `ingress-nginx-controller` DaemonSet to version `1.11.5`. For guidance on upgrading your Palette version,
  refer to the [Palette Enterprise](../../enterprise-version/upgrade/upgrade.md) or
