We aim to provide you with the most up-to-date information about the security of our products and services. No matter
how carefully engineered the services are, from time to time, it may be necessary to notify you of security and privacy
events with our services, including the security notifications we receive related to the third-party components we
utilize in our products and services.

## Security Bulletins

We release [security bulletins](./reports/reports.md) on regular basis addressing security vulnerabilities
in our software or related third-party components, describing their remediation when available, and providing links to
the applicable updates for affected software when available.

## Security Advisories

Security Advisories are a supplement to the Security Bulletins. They address security changes that may not require a
security bulletin but may still affect our customers' overall security. Security Advisories are a way for us to
communicate security information to you about issues that may not be classified as vulnerabilities and may not require a
security bulletin.
