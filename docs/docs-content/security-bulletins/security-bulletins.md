We aim to provide you with the most up-to-date information about the security of our products and services. No matter
how carefully engineered the services are, from time to time, it may be necessary to notify you of security and privacy
events with our services, including the security notifications we receive related to the third-party components we
utilize in our products and services.

## Security Bulletins

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
We release <VersionedLink text="security bulletins" url="/security-bulletins/reports/" />  on a daily and ad-hoc basis addressing security vulnerabilities in our software or
related third-party components, describing their remediation when available, and providing links to the applicable
updates for affected software when available.

## Security Advisories

Security Advisories are a supplement to the Security Bulletins. They provide deeper context on CVEs, including a clear
description of the incident, an explanation of impact and risks, and specific instructions to mitigate or remediate
vulnerabilities.
