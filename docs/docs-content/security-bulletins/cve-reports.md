# Security Bulletins

The vulnerabilities reported in this Security Bulletin include vulnerabilities within the Palette solution and
third-party component vulnerabilities, which we have become aware of. Some of the listed vulnerabilities below have been
fixed in new versions of our products and released in the last month. These vulnerabilities are discovered via our Bug
Bounty program, our security monitoring program, or reported to us by our supply chain.

:::info

The CVSS Severity is provided by either the third-party service provider, or NIST CVE. We do not provide the criticality
score for third-party components. Previous security bulletins are available in the
[Security Bulletins Archive](../unlisted/cve-reports.md).

:::

To fix all the vulnerabilities impacting your products, we recommends patching your instances to the latest version
regarding any third-party components. For vulnerabilities originating in our products, we will provide mitigations and
workarounds where applicable

| 2/8/23           | 2/4/24        | Palette 4.4.8              | Third-party component: OpenSSL            | The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes the "name" (e.g. "CERTIFICATE"), any header data and the payload data. If the function succeeds then the "name_out", "header" and "data" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. | [CVE-2022-4450](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-4450)   | [7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-4450)  |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
