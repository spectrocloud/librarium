# Security Bulletins

The vulnerabilities reported in this Security Bulletin include vulnerabilities within the Palette solution and
third-party component vulnerabilities, which we have become aware of. Some of the listed vulnerabilities below have been
fixed in new versions of our products and released in the last month. These vulnerabilities are discovered via our Bug
Bounty program, our security monitoring program, or reported to us by our supply chain.

:::info

The CVSS Severity is provided by either the third-party service provider, or NIST CVE. We do not provide the criticality
score for third-party components. Previous security bulletins are available in the
[Security Bulletins Archive](../unlisted/cve-reports.md).

:::

To fix all the vulnerabilities impacting your products, we recommends patching your instances to the latest version
regarding any third-party components. For vulnerabilities originating in our products, we will provide mitigations and
workarounds where applicable

| Palette 4.4.8              | Third-party component: Github                                | Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, repositories with submodules can be crafted in a way that exploits a bug in Git whereby it can be fooled into writing files not into the submodule's worktree but into a `.git/` directory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [CVE-2024-32002](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32002) | [9.0](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32002) |
| Palette 4.4.8              | Third-party component: KRB5                                  | PAC parsing in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.19.4 and 1.20.x before 1.20.1 has integer overflows that may lead to remote code execution (in KDC, kadmind, or a GSS or Kerberos application server) on 32-bit platforms (which have a resultant heap-based buffer overflow) and cause a denial of service on other platforms. This occurs in krb5_pac_parse in lib/krb5/krb/pac.c. Heimdal before 7.7.1 has "a similar bug."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [CVE-2022-42898](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42898) | [8.8](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42898) |
| Palette 4.4.8              | Third-party component: CLI Tool runc                         | Runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. In runc 1.1.11 and earlier due to an internal file descriptor leak an attacker could cause a newly-spawned container process (from runc exec) to have a working directory in the host filesystem namespace allowing for a container escape by giving access to the host file system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [CVE-2024-21626](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21626) | [8.6](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21626)                                                    |

This can be dangerous in certain cases such as when dumping memory state or assuming the status of standard i/o file descriptors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [CVE-2023-29403](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29403)                                                    | [7.8](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29403)                                                    |
| Palette 4.4.8              | Third-party component: Linux Kernel                          | In the Linux kernel the following vulnerability has been resolved: bpf: Defer the free of inner map when necessary When updating or deleting an inner map in map array or map htab the map may still be accessed by non-sleepable program or sleepable program. However bpf_map_fd_put_ptr() decreases the ref-counter of the inner map directly through bpf_map_put() if the ref-counter is the last one (which is true for most cases) the inner map will be freed by ops->map_free() in a kworker. But for now most .map_free() callbacks don't use synchronize_rcu() or its variants to wait for the elapse of a RCU grace period so after the invocation of ops->map_free completes the bpf program which is accessing the inner map may incur use-after-free problem. | [CVE-2023-52447](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52447)                                                    | [7.8](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52447)                                                    |
| Palette 4.4.8              | Third-party component: glibc library                         | A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the \_\_vsyslog_internal function of the glibc library. This function is called by the syslog and vsyslog functions. This issue occurs when the openlog function was not called or called with the ident argument set to NULL and the program name (the basename of argv[0]) is bigger than 1024 bytes resulting in an application crash or local privilege escalation.

If the function succeeds then the "name_out" "header" and "data" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur.

In particular it appears as if the removal of PKCS#1 padding may leak timing information which in turn could be used to recover session key bits.
