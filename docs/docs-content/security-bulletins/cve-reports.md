## April 2, 2024 - CVE-2024-3094 Malicious Code in XZ Utility - 10 CVSS

Malicious code was discovered in the upstream tarballs of the XZ utility, starting with version 5.6.0, contain malicious
code. This code is hidden within a test file in the source code and is extracted by the liblzma build process. The code
then modifies specific functions in the liblzma library, resulting in a modified version of the library. Any software
that links against this modified library may have its data interaction intercepted and modified. You can learn more
about the vulnerability in the [CVE-2024-3094](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3094) reference page.

#### Impact

No impact. None of the OS distributions supported by Palette use the impacted versions of the XZ utils package. Below
are the links to the security advisories for all the Palette supported OS distributions:

## January 10, 2024 - CVE-2023-39323 Bypass CGO Restrictions - 8.1 CVSS

Line directives `//line` can be used to bypass the restrictions on `//go:cgo_` directives, allowing blocked linker and
compiler flags to be passed during compilation. This can result in unexpected execution of arbitrary code when issuing
the command `go build`. The line directive requires the absolute path of the file in which the directive resides, which
makes exploiting this issue significantly more complex.

#### Impact

No impact. This is not a runtime issue and we do not compile untrusted code.

## January 10, 2024 - CVE-2023-45283 Filepath Package and Special Prefixes - 7.5 CVSS

The filepath package does not recognize paths with a `\??\` prefix as special. On Windows, a path beginning with `\??\`
is a Root Local Device (RDL) path equivalent to a path beginning with `\\?\`. Paths with a `\??\` prefix may be used to
access arbitrary locations on the system. For example, the path `\??\c:\x` is equivalent to the more common path `c:\x`.

Before the fix, the `Clean` function could convert a rooted path such as `\a\..\??\b` into the RDL path `\??\b`. `Clean`
will now convert this to `.\??\b`. Similarly, before the fix, `Join(\, ??, b)` could convert a seemingly innocent
sequence of path elements into the RDL path \??\b. Join will now convert this to `\.\??\b`.

In the fix version, the function `IsAbs` now correctly reports paths beginning with `\??\` as absolute, and VolumeName
correctly reports the `\??\` prefix as a volume name.

Go 1.20.11 and Go 1.21.4 inadvertently changed the definition of the volume name in Windows paths starting with `\?`,
resulting in `filepath.Clean(\?\c:)` returning `\?\c:` rather than `\?\c:\` among other effects. The previous expected
behavior has been restored in the new version releases.

#### Impact

No impact. This only impacts Windows and Palette does not use Windows operating systems for runtime operations.

## January 10, 2024 - CVE-2023-45285 Insecure Fetching of Go Modules - 7.5 CVSS

Using the command `go get` to fetch a module with the `.git` suffix may unexpectedly fallback to the insecure `git://`
protocol if the module is unavailable via the secure `https://` and `git+ssh://` protocols, even if `GOINSECURE` is not
set for said module. This only affects users who are not using the module proxy and are fetching modules directly and
bypassing the Go proxy with `GOPROXY=off`.

#### Impact

No impact. This is not a runtime issue and we do not use any dependent module with `.git` suffix.

## January 10, 2024 - CVE-2023-39325 Excessive Server Resource Consumption - 7.5 CVSS

A malicious HTTP/2 client that rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource
consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the `http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams` setting, resetting
an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing.

With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers are now bound by the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the
stream concurrency limit `MaxConcurrentStreams`.

If a client sends a new request when the server is already processing the maximum number of requests, the new request
will be queued and wait for a handler to become available. However, if the queue of pending requests grows too large,
the server will terminate the connection. This will happen only after the client has reset an existing request that is
still being processed by the server.

This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency
limit is 250 streams requests per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2
package. Refer to the `Server.MaxConcurrentStreams` setting and the `ConfigureServer` function for more details.

#### Impact

All Palette and VerteX releases prior to version 4.2.0 are impacted. The impact is largely mitigated as Palette and
VerteX already have IP address based rate limit.

#### Patches

Palette and VerteX version 4.1.0 includes the fix for all the services using the HTTP/2 protocol.

### Workarounds

No workaround available. Impact is largely mitigated by the rate limits on the API requests. Refer to the
[API Rate Limit](/api/introduction#rate-limits) documentation for more information.

## January 10, 2024 - CVE-2019-0190 Denial of service - 7.5 CVSS

A bug exists in the way `mod_ssl` handled client renegotiations. A remote attacker could send a carefully crafted
request that would cause `mod_ssl` to enter a loop leading to a denial of service. This bug can be only triggered with
Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.37 when using OpenSSL version 1.1.1 or later, due to an interaction in changes to
handling of renegotiation attempts.

#### Impact

Not Applicable. Apache HTTP server with OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later is not used.

## January 10, 2024 - CVE-2022-4886 Nginx Path Sanitization Bypass - 8.8 CVSS

The Kubernetes [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) controller path sanitization feature can be
bypassed with the `log_format` directive.

#### Impact

No impact on Palette SaaS, self-hosted Palette, or VerteX deployments. We do not allow end user to create or update
ingress objects. Tenant clusters using the Nginx ingress controller pack with versions older than v1.8.0 may be impacted
if they expose the ability for end users to create or update ingress objects.

#### Patches

No fix is available yet, but there is a remediation available starting with Nginx ingress controller v1.8.0. The Nginx
ingress controller pack is available with a newer version v1.9.4. The newer version has `enable-annotation-validation`
set to `true` by default.

### Workarounds

Starting with Nginx version v1.8.0, ingress administrators can set the `--strict-validate-path-type` flag to `true` to
validate ingress rules having `pathType` as "Exact" or "Prefix". If the `pathType` is `ImplementationSpecific` then an
admission controller policy is required to filter out the malicious path. Check out the
[OpenPolicyAgent and pathType enforcing](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/examples/openpolicyagent/)
documentation for more information.

Tenant clusters using older Nginx ingress controller packs can upgrade to version v1.9.4 which has
`strict-validate-path-type` set to `true` by default.

## January 10, 2024 - CVE-2023-5043 Ingress Nginx Annotation Injection - 8.8 CVSS

The Kubernetes [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) controller annotations can be used to inject
arbitrary commands that are later executed.

#### Impact

No impact on Palette SaaS, self-hosted Palette and VerteX deployments. We do not allow end user to create or update
ingress objects. Tenant clusters using the Nginx ingress controller pack with versions older than v1.8.0 may be impacted
if they expose the ability for end users to create or update ingress objects.

#### Patches

No fix is available yet, but there is a remediation available starting with Nginx ingress controller v1.9.0. The Nginx
ingress controller pack is available with a newer version v1.9.4. The new version has `enable-annotation-validation` set
to `true` by default.

### Workarounds

Starting with Nginx version v1.9.0, Ingress administrators should set the `--enable-annotation-validation` flag to
enforce restrictions on the contents of ingress-nginx annotation fields. Tenant clusters using older Nginx ingress
controller pack versions can upgrade the pack to version 1.9.4 which has `enable-annotation-validation` set to `true` by
default.

## October 17, 2023 - CVE-2023-4911 Buffer Overflow in Dynamic Loader - 7.8 CVSS

A buffer overflow was discovered in the GNU C Library’s dynamic loader `ld.so` while processing the `GLIBC_TUNABLES`
environment variable. This issue could allow a local attacker to use maliciously crafted `GLIBC_TUNABLES` environment
variables when launching binaries with `SUID` permission to execute code with elevated privileges.

#### Impact

All internal Palette and VerteX microservices are not impacted as the binaries are compiled using
[musl](https://musl.libc.org). This vulnerability, from an OS perspective, cannot be exploited without a remote code
execution exploit.

#### Patches

Palette version 4.1.0 includes the security patch for the vulnerability.

#### Workarounds

Self-hosted instances of Palette and VerteX need to upgrade to version 4.1.0 or greater. Tenant Clusters and Private
Cloud Gateways can be patched using the on-demand or scheduled OS security patches apply feature. Refer to the

The HTTP/2 protocol may be used to create a denial of service and cause a server to exhaust all of its allocated
resources. A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive
server resource consumption.

#### Impact

All Palette and VerteX releases prior to version 4.1.0 are impacted. The impact is largely mitigated as Palette and
VerteX already has IP address based rate limit.

#### Patches

Palette and VerteX version 4.1.0 includes the fix for all the services using HTTP/2 protocol.

### Workarounds

No workaround available. Impact is largely mitigated by the rate limits on the API requests. Refer to the

## September 25, 2023 - CVE-2023-4863 Libwebp Programs Terminations - 8.8 CVSS

A heap buffer overflow in the library, `libwebp`, allows a remote attacker to perform an out of bounds memory write via
a crafted HTML page. This vulerability is present with the combination of Google Chrome prior to versions 116.0.5845.187
with `libwebp` version 1.3.2. This is Chromium security severity that is marked as Critical.

#### Impact

No impact since `libwebp` is not used on any of the Palette container images. This vulnerability, from an OS perspective
OS, a cannot be exploited without a remote code execution exploit.

#### Patches

Release 4.1.0 of self-hosted Palette and VerteX deployment include the security patch for the CVE.

#### Workarounds

Self-hosted instances of Palette and VerteX need to upgrade to version 4.1.0 or greater. Tenant Clusters and Private
Cloud Gateways can be patched using the on-demand or scheduled OS security patches apply feature. Refer to the

## September 01, 2023 - CVE-2023-22809 Sudo Vulnerability - 7.8 CVSS

The sudo program version 1.9.12p2 and earlier mishandles extra arguments passed in the user-provided environment
variables `SUDO_EDITOR`, `VISUAL`, and `EDITOR` when the `sudoedit` command is executed.

The mishandling allows a local attacker to append arbitrary entries to the list of files to process. This can lead to
privilege escalation. Affected versions are 1.8.0 through 1.9.12.p1. The problem exists because a user-specified editor
may contain the `--` argument that defeats a protection mechanism. For example, an attacker may issue the following
command `EDITOR='vim -- /path/to/extra/file` value.

### Impact

This vulnerability affects the following Palette components:

- Self-hosted Palette instances with versions older than 4.0.0

- Private Cloud Gateways instances with versions older than 4.0.0

- Clusters deployed with Palette versions older than 4.0.0

### Patches

For self-hosted Palette environments, upgrade to Palette version 4.0.0 or greater. Upgrading Palette will automatically
update the OS.

### Workarounds

For clusters and Private Cloud Gateways, patch the OS. You can use the on-demand or scheduled features to apply the OS
security patches. Refer to the [OS Patching](../clusters/cluster-management/os-patching.md) documentation for more
information.

## September 01, 2023 - CVE-2023-24538 - HTML Template Vulnerability - Security Advisory - 9.8 CVSS

Go templates do not consider backticks as a Javascript string delimiter and, as a result, do not escape them as
expected. Backticks have been used since ES6 for JS template literals. If a Go template contains an action within a
literal Javascript template, the action's contents can be used to terminate the literal and potentially inject arbitrary
Javascript code into the Go template.

Go template actions are disallowed from being used inside of them, for example, `"var a = {{.}}"` since there is no safe
way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With this fix,
`Template.Parse()` returns an error when it encounters templates containing actions with literal JavaScript. The
ErrorCode has a value of 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21.
Users who rely on the previous behavior can re-enable it using the `GODEBUG flag jstmpllitinterp=1` with the caveat that
backticks will now be escaped.

### Impact

No impact. We use the Go package [html/template](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template) and our HTML templates are static. We

A security vulnerability in `sudo -e` option (aka _sudoedit_) allows a malicious user with sudoedit privileges to edit
arbitrary files. The Palette container `palette-controller-manager:mold-manager` incorporates a sudo version affected by
sudoers policy bypass in sudo when using sudoedit.

All versions of Palette before v2.6.70 are affected.

#### Impact

A local user with permission to edit files can use this flaw to change a file not permitted by the security policy,
resulting in privilege escalation.

#### Resolution

- For Palette SaaS, this has been addressed and requires no user action.
- For ​​Palette self-hosted deployments, please upgrade to newer versions greater than or equal to v2.6.70 to address
  the reported vulnerability.

#### Workarounds

None.

## August 4, 2022 - CVE-2022-1292 c_rehash script vulnerability in vSphere CSI pack - 9.8 CVSS

On May 3 2022, OpenSSL published a security advisory disclosing a command injection vulnerability in the `c_rehash`
script included with the OpenSSL library. Some operating systems automatically execute this script as a part of normal
operations, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.

Palette is not directly affected by this vulnerability. However, if your cluster profile is using the vSphere CSI pack,
version v2.3 or below, it contains a vulnerable version of the `c_rehash` script.

#### Impact

The `c_rehash` script does not sanitize shell metacharacters properly to prevent command injection. This script is
distributed by some operating systems, and by extension, in container images, in a manner where it is automatically
executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script.

#### Resolution

This vulnerability has been addressed in the vSphere CSI pack greater than or equal to version v2.6.

#### Workarounds

Update cluster profiles using the vSphere CSI pack to version v2.6 or greater. Apply the updated cluster profile changes
to all clusters consuming the cluster profile.
