| Impacted Product & Version | Vulnerability Type                | Impacted Component | Vulnerability Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | CVE ID                                                            | CVSS Severity             |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Palette 4.4                | Third-party component: Ubuntu     | Linux Kernel       | ATA over Ethernet (AoE) driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.                                           | [CVE-2023-6270](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2023-6270)        | 7.0                       |
| Palette 4.4                | Third-party component: Ubuntu     | Linux Kernel       | Atheros 802.11ac wireless driver did not properly validate certain data structures, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service.                                                                    | [CVE-2023-7042](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2023-7042)        | 5.5                       |
| Palette 4.4                | Third-party component: Ubuntu     | Linux Kernel       | HugeTLB file system component of the Linux Kernel contained a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability. A privileged attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service.                                                                               | [CVE-2024-0841](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2024-0841)        | 7.8                       |
| Palette 4.4                | Third-party component: Ubuntu     | Linux Kernel       | Intel Data Streaming and Intel Analytics Accelerator drivers in the Linux kernel allowed direct access to the devices for unprivileged users and virtual machines. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.                                | [CVE-2024-21823](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2024-21823)      | Not Available             |
| Palette 4.4                | Third-party component: Ubuntu     | Linux Kernel       | Yuxuan Hu discovered that the Bluetooth RFCOMM protocol driver in the Linux Kernel contained a race condition, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).                          | [CVE-2024-22099](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2024-22099)      | 5.5                       |
| Palette 4.4                | Third-party component: Ubuntu     | Linux Kernel       | MediaTek SoC Gigabit Ethernet driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition when stopping the device. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (device unavailability).                                                    | [CVE-2024-27432](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2024-27432)      | Not Available             |
| Palette 4.4                | Third-party component: Ubuntu     | Linux Kernel       | Ubuntu released 146 additional vulnerabilities related to Linux Kernel                                                                                                                                                                                          | [USN-6820-1](https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6820-1)      | Varying                   |
| Palette 4.4, 4.3, 4.2…     | Third-party component: Kubernetes | Kubernetes         | Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It’s possible for authenticated users to enumerate clusters by name by inspecting error messages. It’s also possible to enumerate the names of projects with project-scoped clusters. | [CVE-2024-36106](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36106) | Awaiting Analysis by NIST |
| Palette 4.4, 4.3, 4.2…     | Third-party component: Kubernetes | Kubernetes         | Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to the sensitive settings exposed by `/api/v1/settings` endpoint without authentication.                                                 | [CVE-2024-37152](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-37152) | Awaiting Analysis by NIST |
