This page provides a listing of vulnerabilities found in the image **u-2204-0-k-1322-0**.

## Overview

- **Summary**: Security Advisory for Ubuntu 22.04 with Kubernetes 1.32.2
- **Initial Notice Published**: 03/18/2025
- **Last Updated**: 03/29/2025
- **Justification**: This CVE identifies an integer overflow vulnerability found in libexpat versions prior to 2.6.3, which can lead to an integer overflow in the nextScaffoldPart function on 32-bit platforms. This vulnerability can be exploited over a network without user interaction and has very low attack complexity. Not all of the images affected use the specific function affected. 
 
Exploiting this vulnerability in Palette deployments will require an external user to compromise the network controls and gain privileged access. There are controls in place which makes the exploitation difficult. Fix is available in libexpat versions > 2.6.3. Once the fixed version of the library is adoped by 3rd party images, we will incorporate those in our products
