## NIST CVE Summary

sha256crypt and sha512crypt through 0.6 allow attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) because the algorithm's runtime is proportional to the square of the length of the password.

## CVE Severity

[7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2016-20013)

## Our Official Summary

This denial of service attack is reported on some third party containers used by the product. Risk of exploitation of this vulnerability for our products is low, since this requires attacker to have privileged access to the containers and do not allow arbitrary code to be run on them. Impact of exploitation is also low since containers have a limited attack surface. Third party containers in which this vulnerability is reported do not have an upstream fix. We will upgrade the images once the upstream fix becomes available.
