## CVE Details

Visit the official vulnerability details page for [CVE-2023-0216](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-0216) to learn more.

## Initial Publication

10/25/2024

## Last Update

01/20/2025

## Third Party Dependency 

openssl


## NIST CVE Summary

An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an
application tries to load malformed PKCS7 data with the
d2i_PKCS7(), d2i_PKCS7_bio() or d2i_PKCS7_fp() functions.

The result of the dereference is an application crash which could
lead to a denial of service attack. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL
does not call this function however third party applications might
call these functions on untrusted data.



## CVE Severity

[7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-0216)

## Our Official Summary

OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an invalid pointer dereference related to the incorrect handling of malformed PKCS7 data. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to crash.

The images where this vulnrability is have controls in place are not accessible outside the cluster. So the attacker needs to gain privileged access to the cluster to attempt this exploit. Also the containers do not allow execution of arbitrary code. Impact of this exploit is also low, since container reduces the attack surface.
