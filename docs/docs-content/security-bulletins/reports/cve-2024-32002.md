## CVE Details

[CVE-2024-32002](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32002)

## Last Update

10/10/2024

## NIST CVE Summary

Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4,
repositories with submodules can be crafted in a way that exploits a bug in Git whereby it can be fooled into writing
files not into the submodule's worktree but into a `.git/` directory. This allows writing a hook that will be executed
while the clone operation is still active, giving the user no opportunity to inspect the code that is being executed.
The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4. If symbolic link
support is disabled in Git (e.g. via `git config --global core.symlinks false`), the described attack won't work. As
always, it is best to avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources.

## Our Official Summary

A critical vulnerability in Git has recently been published that could lead to remote command injection. The
exploitation occurs when the victim clones a malicious repository recursively, which would execute hooks contained in
the submodules. The vulnerability lies in the way Git handles symbolic links in repository submodules. There are
currently several PoCs with public exploits that expose the vulnerability. This risk of this vulnerability exploited in
spectrocloud products is very low.
