# Security Bulletins

The vulnerabilities reported in this Security Bulletin include vulnerabilities within the Palette VerteX, Palette
Enterprise, and airgap environments. The reported vulnerabilities also include third-party component vulnerabilities,
which we have become aware of. These vulnerabilities are discovered via our Bug Bounty program, our security monitoring
program, or reported to us by our supply chain.

:::info

The CVSS Severity is provided by either the third-party service provider, or NIST CVE. We do not provide the criticality
score for third-party components. Previous security bulletins are available in the
[Security Bulletins Archive](../../unlisted/cve-reports.md).

:::

To fix all the vulnerabilities impacting your products, we recommend patching your instances to the latest version
regarding any third-party components. For vulnerabilities originating in our products, we will provide mitigations and
workarounds where applicable.
