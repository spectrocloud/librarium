## CVE Details

[CVE-2024-49767](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-49767)

## Last Update

11/7/2024

## NIST CVE Summary

Werkzeug is a Web Server Gateway Interface web application library. Applications using
`werkzeug.formparser.MultiPartParser` corresponding to a version of Werkzeug prior to 3.0.6 to parse
`multipart/form-data` requests (e.g. all flask applications) are vulnerable to a relatively simple but effective
resource exhaustion (denial of service) attack. A specifically crafted form submission request can cause the parser to
allocate and block 3 to 8 times the upload size in main memory. There is no upper limit; a single upload at 1 Gbit/s can
exhaust 32 GB of RAM in less than 60 seconds. Werkzeug version 3.0.6 fixes this issue.
