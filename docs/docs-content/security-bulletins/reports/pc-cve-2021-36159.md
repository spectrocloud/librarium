## NIST CVE Summary

libfetch before 2021-07-26, as used in apk-tools, xbps, and other products, mishandles numeric strings for the FTP and HTTP protocols. The FTP passive mode implementation allows an out-of-bounds read because strtol is used to parse the relevant numbers into address bytes. It does not check if the line ends prematurely. If it does, the for-loop condition checks for the '\\0' terminator one byte too late.

## CVE Severity

[9.1](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2021-36159)

## Our Official Summary

The out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the FTP implementation can be exploited by a malicious bzip2 payload, potentially resulting in a denial of service or 
remote code execution. The risk for our products is low for the following reasons: a) There are no known reports of exploitation from the 3rd party vendors. 
b) These images are not accessible directly for an attacker to send crafted input.
