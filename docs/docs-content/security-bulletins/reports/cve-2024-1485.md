## CVE Details

[CVE-2024-1485](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1485)

## Last Update

10/29/24

## NIST CVE Summary

A flaw was found in the decompression function of registry-support. This issue can be triggered if an unauthenticated
remote attacker tricks a user into parsing a devfile which uses the `parent` or `plugin` keywords. This could download a
malicious archive and cause the cleanup process to overwrite or delete files outside of the archive, which should not be
allowed.

## Our Official Summary

This vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated remote attacker who tricks a user into parsing a devfile with parent or plugin keywords. This malicious interaction could result in the download of a harmful archive, leading the cleanup process to overwrite or delete files outside the intended archive scope. There is no evidence that a public proof-of-concept exists. We are waiting on an upstream fix from the 3rd party vendors and will upgrade the images once the upstream fix becomes available.
