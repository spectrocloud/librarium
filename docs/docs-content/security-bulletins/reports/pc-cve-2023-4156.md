## Our Official Summary

A heap out-of-bounds read flaw was found in builtin.c in the gawk package. This issue may lead to a crash and could be used to read sensitive information. The images where this vulnrability is 
have controls in place are not accessible outside the cluster. So the attacker needs to gain privileged access to the cluster to attempt this exploit. Impact of this exploit is also low, since 
container doesn't allow host breakout.
