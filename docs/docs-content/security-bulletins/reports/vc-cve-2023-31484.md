## Third Party Dependency 

perl-base


## NIST CVE Summary

CPAN.pm before 2.35 does not verify TLS certificates when downloading distributions over HTTPS.

## CVE Severity

[8.1](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-31484)

## Our Official Summary

A flaw was found in Perl's CPAN, which doesn't check TLS certificates when downloading content. This happens due to verify_SSL missing when suing the HTTP::Tiny library during the connection. 
This may allow an attacker to inject into the network path and perform a Man-In-The-Middle attack, causing confidentiality or integrity issues.

The third party images where this vulnerability is reported do not expose HTTP end points. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to get privileges access to this container 
and execute code which the container have controls in place to prevent. Impact of exploitation is also low, since any denial of service will be restricted to the container function.
