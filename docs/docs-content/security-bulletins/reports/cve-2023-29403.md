## CVE Details

[CVE-2023-29403](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29403)

## Last Update

09/18/2024

## NIST CVE Summary

On Unix platforms, the Go runtime does not behave differently when a binary is run with the setuid/setgid bits. This can
be dangerous in certain cases, such as when dumping memory state, or assuming the status of standard i/o file
descriptors. If a setuid/setgid binary is executed with standard I/O file descriptors closed, opening any files can
result in unexpected content being read or written with elevated privileges. Similarly, if a setuid/setgid program is
terminated, either via panic or signal, it may leak the contents of its registers.

## Our Official Summary

This vulnerability is reported on Go runtime in several older versions. Resources such as files and directories may be
inadvertently exposed through mechanisms such as insecure permissions, or when a program accidentally operates on the
wrong object. Third party images on which this vulnerability is reported has to be upgraded.
