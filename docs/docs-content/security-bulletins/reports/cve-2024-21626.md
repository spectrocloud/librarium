## CVE Details

[CVE-2024-21626](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21626)

## Last Update

10/29/2024

## NIST CVE Summary

runc is a CLI tool for spawning and using containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. In runc 1.1.11 and
earlier, due to an internal file descriptor leak, an attacker could cause a newly-spawned container process (from runc
exec) to have a working directory in the host filesystem namespace, allowing for a container escape by giving access to
the host filesystem ("attack 2"). The same attack could be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to
gain access to the host filesystem through runc run ("attack 1"). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could be also be used to
overwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete container escapes ("attack 3a" and "attack 3b"). runc
1.1.12 includes patches for this issue.

## Our Official Summary

A file descriptor leak issue was found in the runc package. These vulnerabilities not only enable malicious actors to
escape containerized environments but also allow for full control over the underlying host system. The presence of these
dependencies in the container does not imply a security risk to the containerized application itself, as it is based on
low-level packages included, and the impact to the container's core functionality is minimal. Upstream fix from the 3rd
party vendors is awaited. We are waiting on an upstream fix from the 3rd party vendors and will upgrade the images once
the upstream fix becomes available.
