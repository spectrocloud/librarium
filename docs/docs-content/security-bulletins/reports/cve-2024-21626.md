## CVE Details

[CVE-2024-21626](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21626)

## Last Update

10/10/2024

## NIST CVE Summary

runc is a CLI tool for spawning and using containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. In runc 1.1.11 and
earlier, due to an internal file descriptor leak, an attacker could cause a newly-spawned container process (from runc
exec) to have a working directory in the host filesystem namespace, allowing for a container escape by giving access to
the host filesystem ("attack 2"). The same attack could be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to
gain access to the host filesystem through runc run ("attack 1"). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could be also be used to
overwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete container escapes ("attack 3a" and "attack 3b"). runc
1.1.12 includes patches for this issue.

## Our Official Summary
