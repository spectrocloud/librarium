## Third Party Dependency

## NIST CVE Summary

An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an
application tries to check a malformed DSA public key by the
EVP_PKEY_public_check() function. This will most likely lead
to an application crash. This function can be called on public
keys supplied from untrusted sources which could allow an attacker
to cause a denial of service attack.

The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call this function
but applications might call the function if there are additional
security requirements imposed by standards such as FIPS 140-3.



## CVE Severity

[7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-0217)

## Our Official Summary

A flaw is found in OpenSSL where an invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application tries to check a malformed DSA public key by the EVP_PKEY_public_check() function, 
most likely leading to an application crash. This function can be called on public keys supplied from untrusted sources, which could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service.

The third party images where this vulnerability is reported do not expose HTTP end points. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to get privileges access to this container
and execute code which the container have controls in place to prevent. Impact of exploitation is also low, since any denial of service will be restricted to the container function.
