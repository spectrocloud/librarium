## Initial Publication

## Last Update

## Third Party Dependency 

libc6


## NIST CVE Summary

An off-by-one heap-based buffer overflow was found in the __vsyslog_internal function of the glibc library. This function is called by the syslog and vsyslog functions. This issue occurs when these functions are called with a message bigger than INT_MAX bytes, leading to an incorrect calculation of the buffer size to store the message, resulting in an application crash. This issue affects glibc 2.37 and newer.

## CVE Severity

[7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-6779)

## Our Official Summary

A buffer overflow occurs when a program tries to write more data into a buffer than it can hold. In this case, an attacker can send a specially crafted input to a vulnerable program, 
causing it to overwrite adjacent memory locations and potentially execute malicious code. This can lead to a wide range of consequences, including unauthorized access, data theft, 
or system crashes.

This is reported on a few of the third party images for which an upstream fix is not available. Probability of exploitation is less likely as attackers need privileged access to these
containers and sufficient controls are in place to prevent that. We will wait for the upstream fix to become available.
