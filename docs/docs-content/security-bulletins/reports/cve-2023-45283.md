## CVE Details

[CVE-2023-45283](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45283)

## Initial Publication

10/25/2024

## Last Update

10/25/2024

## Third Party Dependency

go

## NIST CVE Summary

The filepath package does not recognize paths with a \\??\\ prefix as special. On Windows, a path beginning with \\??\\
is a Root Local Device path equivalent to a path beginning with \\\\?\\. Paths with a \\??\\ prefix may be used to
access arbitrary locations on the system. For example, the path \\??\\c:\\x is equivalent to the more common path c:\\x.
Before fix, Clean could convert a rooted path such as \\a\\..\\??\\b into the root local device path \\??\\b. Clean will
now convert this to .\\??\\b. Similarly, Join(\\, ??, b) could convert a seemingly innocent sequence of path elements
into the root local device path \\??\\b. Join will now convert this to \\.\\??\\b. In addition, with fix, IsAbs now
correctly reports paths beginning with \\??\\ as absolute, and VolumeName correctly reports the \\??\\ prefix as a
volume name. UPDATE: Go 1.20.11 and Go 1.21.4 inadvertently changed the definition of the volume name in Windows paths
starting with \\?, resulting in filepath.Clean(\\?\\c:) returning \\?\\c: rather than \\?\\c:\\ (among other effects).
The previous behavior has been restored.
