## Initial Publication

## Last Update

## Third Party Dependency 

libpcre2-8-0


## NIST CVE Summary

Integer overflow vulnerability in pcre2test before 10.41 allows attackers to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impacts via negative input.

## CVE Severity

[7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2022-41409)

## Our Official Summary

This flaw was found in PCRE2 (Perl Regular Controlled Expressions), where it is susceptible to an integer overflow vulnerability triggered by a negative repeat value in the pcre2test subject line that causes infinite looping. This flaw allows a remote attacker to pass specially crafted data to the application, initiating an integer overflow and executing a denial of service (DoS) attack.

Risk of exploitation of this vulnerability for our products is low, since accessing this command line utility requires attacker to have privileged access to the containers and do not allow arbitrary code to be run on them. Impact of exploitation is also low since containers have a limited attack surface. Third party containers in which this vulnerability is reported do not have an upstream fix. We will upgrade the images once the upstream fix becomes available.
