## CVE Details

[CVE-2024-3651](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3651)

## Last Update

10/10/24

## NIST CVE Summary

A vulnerability was identified in the kjd/idna library, specifically within the `idna.encode()` function, affecting
version 3.6. The issue arises from the function's handling of crafted input strings, which can lead to quadratic
complexity and consequently, a denial of service condition. This vulnerability is triggered by a crafted input that
causes the `idna.encode()` function to process the input with considerable computational load, significantly increasing
the processing time in a quadratic manner relative to the input size.

## Our Official Summary

The idna package is a Python library that provides support for Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA). It
allows encoding and decoding of domain names containing non-ASCII characters. This vulnerability affects versions prior
to 3.7 of the idna package. Domain names cannot exceed 253 characters in length, so enforcing this limit can prevent the
resource consumption issue. However, this workaround may not be foolproof as it relies on the higher-level application
performing input validation. Upgrade the package to > 3.7 version to fix the vulnerability.
