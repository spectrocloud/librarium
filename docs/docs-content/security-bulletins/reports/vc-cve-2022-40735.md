## NIST CVE Summary

The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents that arguably make certain calculations unnecessarily expensive, because the 1996 van Oorschot and Wiener paper found that "(appropriately) short exponents" can be used when there are adequate subgroup constraints, and these short exponents can lead to less expensive calculations than for long exponents. This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation about exponent size, rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys. The specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general, there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. Finally, it is possible for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability and CVE-2002-20001 together.

## CVE Severity

[7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2022-40735)

## Our Official Summary

The vulnerability centres on the use of DHE in a protocol like TLS where the server uses a large private or large parameters. This is reported on a couple of third party images which
are not accessible outside the security perimeter. Risk of exploitation for our products is low as there are sufficient contriols in place. Impact of exploit is also low since a denial
of service if caused will just restart the container. We will wait for fixes from the upstream vendors.
