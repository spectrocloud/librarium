curl


## NIST CVE Summary

libcurl-using applications can ask for a specific client certificate to be used in a transfer. This is done with the \`CURLOPT_SSLCERT\` option (\`--cert\` with the command line tool).When libcurl is built to use the macOS native TLS library Secure Transport, an application can ask for the client certificate by name or with a file name - using the same option. If the name exists as a file, it will be used instead of by name.If the appliction runs with a current working directory that is writable by other users (like \`/tmp\`), a malicious user can create a file name with the same name as the app wants to use by name, and thereby trick the application to use the file based cert instead of the one referred to by name making libcurl send the wrong client certificate in the TLS connection handshake.

## CVE Severity

[7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2021-22926)

## Our Official Summary

Curl libcurl could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by a flaw in the CURLOPT_SSLCERT option mixup with TLS library Secure Transport. By creating a specially-crafted file name with the same name as the app wants to use by name, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trick the application to use the file based cert instead of the one referred to by name, and allow libcurl to send the wrong client certificate in the TLS connection handshake.

Containers where this vulnerabiity is repored, does not allow arbitrary code to execute, which is necessary to exploit this vulnerability. Hence the risk for our products is low. Impact of exploitation
is also low as attack surface is limited to the container image.
