## Third Party Dependency 

pyc


## NIST CVE Summary

There is a LOW severity vulnerability affecting CPython, specifically the
'http.cookies' standard library module.


When parsing cookies that contained backslashes for quoted characters in
the cookie value, the parser would use an algorithm with quadratic
complexity, resulting in excess CPU resources being used while parsing the
value.

## CVE Severity

[7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2024-7592)

## Our Official Summary

Some problematic patterns and their application can lead to exponential time complexity under certain conditions, akin to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. 

The images where this vulnrability is have controls in place are not accessible outside the cluster. So the attacker needs to gain privileged access to the cluster to attempt this exploit. Also the containers do not allow execution of arbitrary code. Impact of this exploit is also low, since container reduces the attack surface.
