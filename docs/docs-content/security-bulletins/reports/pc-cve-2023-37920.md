## Our Official Summary

This vulnerability was found in the python-certifi package. eTurgra certificates are marked as untrusted by Mozilla and
were removed from Mozilla's root store in July 2023. This issue occurs when the e-Tugra root certificate in Certifi is
removed, resulting in an unspecified error that has an unknown impact and attack vector. This issue is mostly impacted
during the use of web browsers. The vulnerability exploitation likelihood in the calico cni images is low. We are
