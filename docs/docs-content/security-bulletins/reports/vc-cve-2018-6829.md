## Initial Publication

10/25/2024

## Last Update

02/17/2025

## Third Party Dependency 

libgcrypt20


## NIST CVE Summary

cipher/elgamal.c in Libgcrypt through 1.8.2, when used to encrypt messages directly, improperly encodes plaintexts, which allows attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading ciphertext data (i.e., it does not have semantic security in face of a ciphertext-only attack). The Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption does not hold for Libgcrypt's ElGamal implementation.

## CVE Severity

[7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2018-6829)

## Our Official Summary

cipher/elgamal.c in Libgcrypt through 1.8.2, when used to encrypt messages directly, improperly encodes plaintexts, which allows attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading ciphertext 
data (i.e., it does not have semantic security in face of a ciphertext-only attack). The Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption does not hold for Libgcrypt's ElGamal implementation. This 
is not a security flaw in libgcrypt. However if an application uses The El-gamal algorithm implemented by libgcrypt in a particular way than the application would be vulnerable to security flaw(s). 

There is no documented instance of the third party images where this vulnerability is reported being affected by this flaw. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to get 
privileges access to this container and execute code which the container have controls in place to prevent. Impact of exploitation is also low, since any denial of service will be restricted 
to the container function.
