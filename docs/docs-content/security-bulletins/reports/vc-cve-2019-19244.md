## Third Party Dependency

## NIST CVE Summary

sqlite3Select in select.c in SQLite 3.30.1 allows a crash if a sub-select uses both DISTINCT and window functions, and also has certain ORDER BY usage.

## CVE Severity

[7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2019-19244)

## Our Official Summary

This vulnerability found in SQLite can be remotely exploited by sending sql queries with DISTINCT, OVER and ORDER BY clauses. This will cause application crashes causing a denial of service
attack. 

Containers where this vulnerability is reported do not allow access to the sqlite database without an attacker gaining privileged access to the images. Even then risk of exploitation is low
since there are controls to prevent execution of arbitrary commands.
