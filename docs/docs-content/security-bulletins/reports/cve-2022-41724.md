## CVE Details

[CVE-2022-41724](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41724)

## Last Update

10/10/2024

## NIST CVE Summary

Large handshake records may cause panics in crypto/tls. Both clients and servers may send large TLS handshake records
which cause servers and clients, respectively, to panic when attempting to construct responses. This affects all TLS 1.3
clients, TLS 1.2 clients which explicitly enable session resumption (by setting Config.ClientSessionCache to a non-nil
value), and TLS 1.3 servers which request client certificates (by setting Config.ClientAuth >= RequestClientCert).

## Our Official Summary

A vulnerability in crypto-tls in Go affects the component TLS Handshake Handler. The product does not properly control
the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, when handling large handshake records, thereby enabling an actor
to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources. A fix is
available in latest versions of go. All the images affected will be upgraded to the latest versions.
