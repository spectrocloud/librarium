## NIST CVE Summary

There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing
inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but
the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type
of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by
the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an
ASN1_STRING.

When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the
X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass
arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or
enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to
provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a
valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other
input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which
is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect
applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs
over a network.

## CVE Severity

[7.4](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-0286)

## Our Official Summary

A type confusion vulnerability was found in OpenSSL when OpenSSL X.400 addresses processing inside an X.509 GeneralName. This vulnerability is likely only to affect applications that have 
implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network.

The third party images where this vulnerability is reported do not allow running arbitraty code which limits the risk of exploitation. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker 
needs to get privileges access to this container and execute code which the container have controls in place to prevent. Impact of exploitation is also low, since any denial of service 
will be restricted to the container function.
