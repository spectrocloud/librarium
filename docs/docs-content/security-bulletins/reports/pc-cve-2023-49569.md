## Third Party Dependency

## NIST CVE Summary

A path traversal vulnerability was discovered in go-git versions prior to v5.11. This vulnerability allows an attacker to create and amend files across the filesystem. In the worse case scenario, remote code execution could be achieved.

Applications are only affected if they are using the  ChrootOS https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5/osfs#ChrootOS , which is the default when using "Plain" versions of Open and Clone funcs (e.g. PlainClone). Applications using  BoundOS https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5/osfs#BoundOS  or in-memory filesystems are not affected by this issue.
This is a go-git implementation issue and does not affect the upstream git cli.




## CVE Severity

[9.8](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-49569)

## Our Official Summary

This problem only affects the go implementation and not the original git cli code. Applications using BoundOS or in-memory filesystems are not affected by this issue. Clients should be limited to 
connect to only trusted git servers to reduce the risk of compromise.

A upstream fix for the 3rd party images is awaited. Will adopt the fixed version once it becomes available.
