## Last Update

10/10/2024

## NIST CVE Summary

Angle brackets `<>` are not considered dangerous characters when inserted into CSS contexts. Templates containing
multiple actions separated by a `/` character can result in unexpectedly closing the CSS context and allowing for
injection of unexpected HTML, if executed with untrusted input.

## Our Official Summary

A vulnerability was found in html-template up to 1.19.8/1.20.3 on Go. The affected component is the CSS Handler.
Manipulation with an unknown input could lead to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. If the input contains special
characters such as `"<", ">"`, and `"&"` that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a
downstream component that processes web pages. A fix for the images affected will be investigated.
