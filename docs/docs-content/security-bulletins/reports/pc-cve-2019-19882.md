## NIST CVE Summary

shadow 4.8, in certain circumstances affecting at least Gentoo, Arch Linux, and Void Linux, allows local users to obtain root access because setuid programs are misconfigured. Specifically, this affects shadow 4.8 when compiled using --with-libpam but without explicitly passing --disable-account-tools-setuid, and without a PAM configuration suitable for use with setuid account management tools. This combination leads to account management tools (groupadd, groupdel, groupmod, useradd, userdel, usermod) that can easily be used by unprivileged local users to escalate privileges to root in multiple ways. This issue became much more relevant in approximately December 2019 when an unrelated bug was fixed (i.e., the chmod calls to suidusbins were fixed in the upstream Makefile which is now included in the release version 4.8).

## CVE Severity

[7.8](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2019-19882)

## Our Official Summary

This issue only affects the shadow-utils package when compiled with the "with-libpam" option. The highest threat from this vulnerability is confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.  The images where this vulnerability is have controls in place are not accessible outside the cluster. So the attacker needs to gain privileged access to 
the cluster to attempt this exploit. Also the containers do not allow execution of arbitrary code. Impact of this exploit is also low, since container reduces the attack surface.
