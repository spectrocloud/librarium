## NIST CVE Summary

Multipart form parsing can consume large amounts of CPU and memory when processing form inputs containing very large numbers of parts. This stems from several causes: 1. mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm limits the total memory a parsed multipart form can consume. ReadForm can undercount the amount of memory consumed, leading it to accept larger inputs than intended. 2. Limiting total memory does not account for increased pressure on the garbage collector from large numbers of small allocations in forms with many parts. 3. ReadForm can allocate a large number of short-lived buffers, further increasing pressure on the garbage collector. The combination of these factors can permit an attacker to cause an program that parses multipart forms to consume large amounts of CPU and memory, potentially resulting in a denial of service. This affects programs that use mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, as well as form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. With fix, ReadForm now does a better job of estimating the memory consumption of parsed forms, and performs many fewer short-lived allocations. In addition, the fixed mime/multipart.Reader imposes the following limits on the size of parsed forms: 1. Forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 1000 parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxparts=. 2. Form parts parsed with NextPart and NextRawPart may contain no more than 10,000 header fields. In addition, forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 10,000 header fields across all parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxheaders=.

## CVE Severity

[7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-24536)

## Our Official Summary

This vulnerability is a false positive. Although this is reported by the scanning tools on some of the components, further checks indicate the symbol/function with the vulnerability while present is not being used.

| 01/20/2025 | Official summary revised: This vulnerability is a false positive. Although this is reported by the scanning tools on some of the components, further checks indicate the symbol/function with the vulnerability while present is not being used. |
| 12/16/2024 | Impacted versions changed from 4.5.4, 4.5.5, 4.5.8, 4.4.20, 4.5.10, 4.5.11 to 4.5.4, 4.5.5, 4.5.8, 4.4.20, 4.5.10, 4.5.11, 4.5.15 |
| 12/11/2024 | Official summary revised: A flaw was found in Golang Go, where it is vulnerable to a denial of service caused by an issue during multipart form parsing. By sending a specially crafted input, a remote attacker can consume large amounts of CPU and memory, resulting in a denial of service. The risk scenario is low for the following reasons: These images does not allow arbitrary code execution and this vulnerability cannot be exploited remotely. There are no known reports of exploitation from the 3rd party vendors; and these images are not accessible directly for an attacker to send crafted input. We will upgrade the images when the fixes become available from the vendors. |
