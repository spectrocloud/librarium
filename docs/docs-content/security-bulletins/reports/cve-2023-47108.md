## Last Update

11/12/2024

## NIST CVE Summary

OpenTelemetry-Go Contrib is a collection of third-party packages for OpenTelemetry-Go. Prior to version 0.46.0, the grpc
Unary Server Interceptor out of the box adds labels `net.peer.sock.addr` and `net.peer.sock.port` that have unbound
cardinality. It leads to the server's potential memory exhaustion when many malicious requests are sent.

## Our Official Summary

This vulnerability is reported on the Kubernetes images such as apiserver, kube-controller-manager, kube-proxy and
kube-scheduler. This flaw is from the open telemetry otelgrpc handler. Kubernetes components use open telemetry only for
tracing and not for metrics collection, making this vulnerability a false positive and the risk of exploitation low.
