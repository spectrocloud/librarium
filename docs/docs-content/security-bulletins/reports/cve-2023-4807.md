## NIST CVE Summary

Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation contains a bug that might corrupt the
internal state of applications on the Windows 64 platform when running on newer X86_64 processors supporting the
AVX512-IFMA instructions. Impact summary: If in an application that uses the OpenSSL library an attacker can influence
whether the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is used, the application state might be corrupted with various application dependent
consequences. The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL does not save the contents of
non-volatile XMM registers on Windows 64 platform when calculating the MAC of data larger than 64 bytes. Before
returning to the caller all the XMM registers are set to zero rather than restoring their previous content. The
vulnerable code is used only on newer x86_64 processors supporting the AVX512-IFMA instructions. The consequences of
this kind of internal application state corruption can be various - from no consequences, if the calling application
does not depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst consequences, where the attacker
could get complete control of the application process. However given the contents of the registers are just zeroized so
the attacker cannot put arbitrary values inside, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result of
some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of service. The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most
frequently used as part of the CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data) algorithm. The
most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol versions 1.2 and 1.3 and a malicious client can influence
whether this AEAD cipher is used by the server. This implies that server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially
impacted. However we are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected by this issue therefore
we consider this a Low severity security issue. As a workaround the AVX512-IFMA instructions support can be disabled at
runtime by setting the environment variable OPENSSL_ia32cap: OPENSSL_ia32cap=:~0x200000 The FIPS provider is not
affected by this issue.
