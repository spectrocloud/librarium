## NIST CVE Summary

On Unix platforms, the Go runtime does not behave differently when a binary is run with the setuid/setgid bits. This can be dangerous in certain cases, such as when dumping memory state, or assuming the status of standard i/o file descriptors. If a setuid/setgid binary is executed with standard I/O file descriptors closed, opening any files can result in unexpected content being read or written with elevated privileges. Similarly, if a setuid/setgid program is terminated, either via panic or signal, it may leak the contents of its registers.

## CVE Severity

[7.8](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-29403)

| 01/20/2025 | Official summary revised: This vulnerability is a false positive. Although this is reported by the scanning tools on some of the components, further checks indicate the symbol/function with the vulnerability while present is not being used. |
| 12/16/2024 | Impacted versions changed from 4.5.4, 4.5.5, 4.5.8, 4.4.20, 4.5.10, 4.5.11 to 4.5.4, 4.5.5, 4.5.8, 4.4.20, 4.5.10, 4.5.11, 4.5.15 |
| 12/11/2024 | Official summary revised: This security flaw occurs if an X.509 certificate contains a malformed policy constraint and policy processing is enabled, then a write lock will be taken twice recursively. This issue results in a denial of service when the affected process hangs. This vulnerability is very platform specific and is reported on Windows OS only. Hence the impact of this CVE on our products is low. The 3rd party kubevirt images in which this vulnerability is reported has no fixed versions available yet.  |
