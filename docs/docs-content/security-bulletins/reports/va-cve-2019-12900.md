## NIST CVE Summary

BZ2_decompress in decompress.c in bzip2 through 1.0.6 has an out-of-bounds write when there are many selectors.

## CVE Severity

[9.8](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2019-12900)

## Our Official Summary

This vulnerability is reported on several of the 3rd party cni images used by our products such as calico and
multus-cni. The out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Bzip2 libraries can be exploited by a malicious bzip2 payload,
potentially resulting in a denial of service or remote code execution. Network services or command line utilities that
decompress untrusted bzip2 payloads are at risk. The risk scenario is low for the following reasons: These images are
optional and will be installed depending on the configuration of the deployments; there are no known reports of
exploitation from the 3rd party vendors; and these images are not accessible directly for an attacker to send crafted
input. We will upgrade the images when the fixes become available from the vendors.
