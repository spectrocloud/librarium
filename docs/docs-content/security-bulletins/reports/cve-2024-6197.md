## CVE Details

[CVE-2024-6197](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-6197)

## Last Update

11/7/2024

## NIST CVE Summary

Libcurl's ASN1 parser has this utf8asn1str() function used for parsing an ASN.1 UTF-8 string. Itcan detect an invalid
field and return error. Unfortunately, when doing so it also invokes `free()` on a 4 byte localstack buffer. Most modern
malloc implementations detect this error and immediately abort. Some however accept the input pointer and add that
memory to its list of available chunks. This leads to the overwriting of nearby stack memory. The content of the
overwrite is decided by the `free()` implementation; likely to be memory pointers and a set of flags. The most likely
outcome of exploting this flaw is a crash, although it cannot be ruled out that more serious results can be had in
special circumstances.

## Our Official Summary

This CVE is reported on nginx-ingress-controller image on the libcurl's ASN1 parser. The vulnerable code path can be
triggered by a malicious operation offering an especially crafted TLS certificate. Problem is fixed in curl
version >=8.9.0. Investigating a possible fix.
