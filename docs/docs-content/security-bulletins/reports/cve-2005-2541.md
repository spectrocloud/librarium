Palette & Vertex Impact Summary

This vulnerability is reported on some 3rd party images used by our products. The vulnerability exploitation scenario
requires specific conditions to be met: the tar extraction must be performed by the root user, and the tarball itself
must be crafted maliciously with setuid or setgid bits. These 3rd party images do not run as root, so the probability of
exploitation is low. We will upgrade the image once the upstream fix becomes available.
