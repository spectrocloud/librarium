## NIST CVE Summary

NATS.io is a high performance open source pub-sub distributed communication technology, built for the cloud, on-premise, IoT, and edge computing. The cryptographic key handling library, nkeys, recently gained support for encryption, not just for signing/authentication. This is used in nats-server 2.10 (Sep 2023) and newer for authentication callouts. In nkeys versions 0.4.0 through 0.4.5, corresponding with NATS server versions 2.10.0 through 2.10.3, the nkeys library's \`xkeys\` encryption handling logic mistakenly passed an array by value into an internal function, where the function mutated that buffer to populate the encryption key to use. As a result, all encryption was actually to an all-zeros key. This affects encryption only, not signing.  
FIXME: FILL IN IMPACT ON NATS-SERVER AUTH CALLOUT SECURITY. nkeys Go library 0.4.6, corresponding with NATS Server 2.10.4, has a patch for this issue. No known workarounds are available. For any application handling auth callouts in Go, if using the nkeys library, update the dependency, recompile and deploy that in lockstep.

## CVE Severity

[7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-46129)

| 01/14/2025 | Official summary revised: This vulnerability is a false positive. Although this is reported by the scanning tools on some of the components, further checks indicate the symbol/function with the vulnerability while present is not being used. |
| 01/11/2025 | Advisory severity revised to MEDIUM from HIGH |
| 01/11/2025 | Advisory is now impacting. |
| 12/16/2024 | Impacted versions changed from 4.5.4, 4.5.5, 4.5.8, 4.5.10, 4.5.11 to 4.5.4, 4.5.5, 4.5.8, 4.5.10, 4.5.11, 4.5.15 |
| 11/28/2024 | Official summary revised: This denial of service attack is reported on some third party containers used by the product. Risk of exploitation of this vulnerability for our products is low, since this requires attacker to have privileged access to the containers and do not allow arbitrary code to be run on them. Impact of exploitation is also low since containers have a limited attack surface. Third party containers in which this vulnerability is reported do not have an upstream fix. We will upgrade the images once the upstream fix becomes available. |
