This issue occurs when validating a certificate chain with cockpit-certificate-ensure. This flaw allows an unauthenticated, remote client or attacker to initiate a denial of service attack.

## CVE Severity

[7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2024-0567)

## Our Official Summary

This vulnerability in GnuTLS, allows an unauthenticated, remote client or attacker to initiate a denial of service attack. The images where this vulnerability is have controls in place are not accessible outside the cluster. So the attacker needs to gain privileged access to the cluster to attempt this exploit. Also the containers do not allow execution of arbitrary code. Impact of this exploit is also low, since container reduces the attack surface.
