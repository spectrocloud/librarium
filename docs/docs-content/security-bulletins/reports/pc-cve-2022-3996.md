## NIST CVE Summary

If an X.509 certificate contains a malformed policy constraint and
policy processing is enabled, then a write lock will be taken twice
recursively.  On some operating systems (most widely: Windows) this
results in a denial of service when the affected process hangs.  Policy
processing being enabled on a publicly facing server is not considered
to be a common setup.

Policy processing is enabled by passing the \`-policy'
argument to the command line utilities or by calling the
\`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.

Update (31 March 2023): The description of the policy processing enablement
was corrected based on CVE-2023-0466.

## CVE Severity

[7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2022-3996)
