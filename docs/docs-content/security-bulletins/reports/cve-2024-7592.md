## Last Update

## NIST CVE Summary

There is a LOW severity vulnerability affecting CPython, specifically the 'http.cookies' standard library module. When
parsing cookies that contained backslashes for quoted characters in the cookie value, the parser would use an algorithm
with quadratic complexity, resulting in excess CPU resources being used while parsing the value.

## Our Official Summary

Some problematic patterns and their application can lead to exponential time complexity under certain conditions, akin
to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. Investigating to see if there is a upstream fix available.
