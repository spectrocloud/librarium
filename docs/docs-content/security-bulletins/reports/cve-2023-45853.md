## CVE Details

[CVE-2023-45853](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45853)

## Last Update

10/14/24

## NIST CVE Summary

MiniZip in zlib through 1.3 has an integer overflow and resultant heap-based buffer overflow in zipOpenNewFileInZip4_64
via a long filename, comment, or extra field. NOTE: MiniZip is not a supported part of the zlib product. NOTE: pyminizip
through 0.2.6 is also vulnerable because it bundles an affected zlib version, and exposes the applicable MiniZip code
through its compress API.

## Our Official Summary

This vulnerability is reported on some of the 3rd party cni images used by our products such as multus-cni. This
heap-based buffer overflow can be exploited through a long filename, comment, or extra field. The risk scenario is low
for the following reasons: These images are optional and will be installed depending on the configuration of the
deployments; there are no known reports of exploitation from the 3rd party vendors; and these images are not accessible
directly for an attacker to send crafted input. We will upgrade the images when the fixes become available from the
vendors.
