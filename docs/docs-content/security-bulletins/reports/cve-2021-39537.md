## NIST CVE Summary

An issue was discovered in ncurses through v6.2-1. \_nc_captoinfo in captoinfo.c has a heap-based buffer overflow.

## Our Official Summary

This vulnerability is reported on some 3rd party images used by our products. This flaw results from a lack of proper
bounds checking during input processing. By exploiting this boundary error, an attacker can create a malicious file,
deceive the victim into opening it using the affected software, and initiate an out-of-bounds write, potentially
impacting system availability. We are waiting on an upstream fix from the 3rd party vendor. We will upgrade the images
once the upstream fix becomes available.
