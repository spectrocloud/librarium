## NIST CVE Summary

HTTP and MIME header parsing can allocate large amounts of memory, even when parsing small inputs, potentially leading to a denial of service. Certain unusual patterns of input data can cause the common function used to parse HTTP and MIME headers to allocate substantially more memory than required to hold the parsed headers. An attacker can exploit this behavior to cause an HTTP server to allocate large amounts of memory from a small request, potentially leading to memory exhaustion and a denial of service. With fix, header parsing now correctly allocates only the memory required to hold parsed headers.

## CVE Severity

[7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-24534)

## Our Official Summary

This CVE involves excessive memory allocation in net/http and net/textproto, potentially leading to a denial of service due to large memory allocation while parsing HTTP and MIME 
headers even for small inputs. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to exhaust an HTTP server's memory resources, causing a denial of service. By crafting specific input data 
patterns, an attacker can trigger the excessive memory allocation behavior in the HTTP and MIME header parsing functions, leading to memory exhaustion.

Risk of this vulnerability exploited in Spectrocloud products is very low. 3rd party images afftected will be upgraded to remove the vulnerability.
