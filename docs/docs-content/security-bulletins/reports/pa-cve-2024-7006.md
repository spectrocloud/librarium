## NIST CVE Summary

A null pointer dereference flaw was found in Libtiff via \`tif_dirinfo.c\`. This issue may allow an attacker to trigger memory allocation failures through certain means, such as restricting the heap space size or injecting faults, causing a segmentation fault. This can cause an application crash, eventually leading to a denial of service.

## CVE Severity

[7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2024-7006)

## Our Official Summary

A null pointer dereference flaw was found in Libtiff via tif_dirinfo.c. This issue may allow an attacker to trigger memory allocation failures through certain means, such as restricting the heap space size or injecting faults, causing a segmentation fault. This can cause an application crash, eventually leading to a denial of service.

The risk of exploitation of this vulnerability for our products is low as these containers canot be modified without privileged access and running arbitrary code. Containers have security controls in place to prevent these actions. We will wait for an upstream fix and then upgrade these components.
