## NIST CVE Summary

Before Go 1.20, the RSA based TLS key exchanges used the math/big library, which is not constant time. RSA blinding was applied to prevent timing attacks, but analysis shows this may not have been fully effective. In particular it appears as if the removal of PKCS#1 padding may leak timing information, which in turn could be used to recover session key bits. In Go 1.20, the crypto/tls library switched to a fully constant time RSA implementation, which we do not believe exhibits any timing side channels.

## CVE Severity

[7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-45287)

## Our Official Summary

This vulnerability in the Golang crypto/tls library potentially allows information retrieval through RSA-based TLS key exchanges. The images where this vulnrability is have controls in place are 
not accessible outside the cluster. So the attacker needs to gain privileged access to the cluster to attempt this exploit. However, the practicality of exploiting this flaw is limited, as it 
requires a significant expertise and skill.
