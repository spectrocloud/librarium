## CVE Details

[CVE-2023-24540](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24540)

## Last Update

10/10/2024

## NIST CVE Summary

Not all valid JavaScript whitespace characters are considered to be whitespace. Templates containing whitespace
characters outside of the character set "\t\n\f\r\u0020\u2028\u2029" in JavaScript contexts that also contain actions
may not be properly sanitized during execution.

## Our Official Summary

This is a vulnerability affecting the Golang Go software, specifically the html/template package. This issue arises from
improper handling of JavaScript whitespace characters in certain contexts, leading to potential security risks. Systems
using Golang Go versions up to 1.19.9 and from 1.20.0 to 1.20.4 are affected, particularly those using the html/template
package with JavaScript contexts containing actions and specific whitespace characters. The images in which
vulnerabilities are report do not use the html package. So possibility of this vulnerability getting exploited in
Spectro Cloud products is low. There is a upstream fix available, we will upgrade to that version.
