## NIST CVE Summary

Programs which compile regular expressions from untrusted sources may be vulnerable to memory exhaustion or denial of service. The parsed regexp representation is linear in the size of the input, but in some cases the constant factor can be as high as 40,000, making relatively small regexps consume much larger amounts of memory. After fix, each regexp being parsed is limited to a 256 MB memory footprint. Regular expressions whose representation would use more space than that are rejected. Normal use of regular expressions is unaffected.

## CVE Severity

[7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2022-41715)

## Our Official Summary

This Denial of Service is limited to the golang runtime. For our products, this would be restricted to a few snapshot related 3rd party containers. There are multiple 
layers of guard rails (resource constraints imposed at the container and cluster levels) which would require a malicious user to continue submitting attacks for there 
to be any enduring impact. Attackers would also need privilged access to cluster running the container as these containers are not exposed beyond the cluster boundary. 
Also these containers are part of an optional feature and is by default not enabled.
