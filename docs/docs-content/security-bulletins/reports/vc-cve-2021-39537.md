## Our Official Summary

This vulnerability is reported on some 3rd party images used by our products. This flaw results from a lack of proper
bounds checking during input processing. By exploiting this boundary error, an attacker can create a malicious file,
deceive the victim into opening it using the affected software, and initiate an out-of-bounds write, potentially
impacting system availability. 

Explotation risk for our products is low because, attacker needs privileged access to trigger this. Impact of exploitation 
is not high as this component doesn't significantly affect overall system availability. We are waiting on an upstream fixes 
from the 3rd party vendor. We will upgrade the images once the upstream fix becomes available.
