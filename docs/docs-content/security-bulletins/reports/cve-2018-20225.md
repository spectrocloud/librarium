## CVE Details

[CVE-2018-20225](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20225)

## Last Update

08/16/2024

## NIST CVE Summary

An issue was discovered in pip (all versions) because it installs the version with the highest version number, even if
the user had intended to obtain a private package from a private index. This only affects use of the --extra-index-url
option, and exploitation requires that the package does not already exist in the public index (and thus the attacker can
put the package there with an arbitrary version number). NOTE: it has been reported that this is intended functionality
and the user is responsible for using --extra-index-url securely
