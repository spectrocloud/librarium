## Our Official Summary

This vulnerability in Perl File::Temp module affects symlinks, which is a very specfiic case. The images where this vulnrability is have controls in place are not accessible outside the cluster. 
So the attacker needs to gain privileged access to the cluster to attempt this exploit. Also the containers do not allow execution of arbitrary code. Impact of this exploit is also low, since 
container reduces the attack surface.
