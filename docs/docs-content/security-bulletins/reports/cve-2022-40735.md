## CVE Details

[CVE-2022-40735](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40735)

## Last Update

11/7/2024

## NIST CVE Summary

The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents that arguably make certain calculations
unnecessarily expensive, because the 1996 van Oorschot and Wiener paper found that "(appropriately) short exponents" can
be used when there are adequate subgroup constraints, and these short exponents can lead to less expensive calculations
than for long exponents. This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation about
exponent size, rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys. The specific situations in which
calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the
DHE implementation details. In general, there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource
consumption from DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. Finally, it is possible for an attacker to exploit this
vulnerability and CVE-2002-20001 together.
