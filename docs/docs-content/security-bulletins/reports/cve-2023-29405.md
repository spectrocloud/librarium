## NIST CVE Summary

The go command may execute arbitrary code at build time when using cgo. This may occur when running "go get" on a
malicious module, or when running any other command which builds untrusted code. This is can by triggered by linker
flags, specified via a "#cgo LDFLAGS" directive. Flags containing embedded spaces are mishandled, allowing disallowed

affects usage of the gccgo compiler.
