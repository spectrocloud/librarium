## NIST CVE Summary

A flaw was found in the decompression function of registry-support. This issue can be triggered if an unauthenticated remote attacker tricks a user into parsing a devfile which uses the \`parent\` or \`plugin\` keywords. This could download a malicious archive and cause the cleanup process to overwrite or delete files outside of the archive, which should not be allowed.

## CVE Severity

[9.3](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2024-1485)

## Our Official Summary

This vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated remote attacker who tricks a user into parsing a devfile with
parent or plugin keywords. This malicious interaction could result in the download of a harmful archive, leading the
cleanup process to overwrite or delete files outside the intended archive scope. There is no evidence that a public
proof-of-concept exists. We are waiting on an upstream fix from the 3rd party vendors and will upgrade the images once
the upstream fix becomes available.
