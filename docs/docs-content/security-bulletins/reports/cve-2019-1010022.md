## CVE Details

[CVE-2019-1010022](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1010022)

## Last Update

11/7/2024

## NIST CVE Summary

GNU Libc current is affected by: Mitigation bypass. The impact is: Attacker may bypass stack guard protection. The
component is: nptl. The attack vector is: Exploit stack buffer overflow vulnerability and use this bypass vulnerability
to bypass stack guard. NOTE: Upstream comments indicate "this is being treated as a non-security bug and no real threat.

## Our Official Summary

The issue relates to a mitigation bypass in the GNU Libc library's NPTL component, allowing attackers to circumvent
stack guard protection via a stack buffer overflow. This is considered a post-attack mitigation rather than a direct
vulnerability by many upstream maintainers. In our products, exploiting this vulnerability on the 3rd party images is
very low since this issue does not directly lead to code execution. Instead, it weakens an additional layer of
protection after an attack has already occurred, thus classifying it as a post-attack hardening issue. We are waiting on
an upstream fix from the 3rd party vendors and will upgrade the images once the upstream fix becomes available.
