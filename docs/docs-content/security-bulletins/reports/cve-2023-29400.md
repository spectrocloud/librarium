## CVE Details

[CVE-2023-29400](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29400)

## Last Update

10/10/2024

## NIST CVE Summary

Templates containing actions in unquoted HTML attributes e.g. `"attr={{.}}"` executed with empty input can result in
output with unexpected results when parsed due to HTML normalization rules. This may allow injection of arbitrary
attributes into tags.

## Our Official Summary

The vulnerability in golang arises from the use of unquoted HTML attributes in templates. When these templates are
executed with empty input, the resulting output may be parsed incorrectly due to HTML normalization rules. This can
enable an attacker to inject arbitrary attributes into HTML tags, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS)
attacks or other security vulnerabilities. All the images in which this CVE is reported are 3rd party images, which do
not process HTML data. So possibility of this vulnerability getting exploited in Spectro Cloud products is low. Waiting
on upsteam fixes.
