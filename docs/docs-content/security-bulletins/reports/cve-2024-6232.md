## CVE Details

[CVE-2024-6232](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-6232)

## Last Update

9/5/24

## NIST CVE Summary

There is a MEDIUM severity vulnerability affecting CPython. Regular expressions that allowed excessive backtracking
during tarfile.TarFile header parsing are vulnerable to ReDoS via specifically-crafted tar archives.

## Our Official Summary

This CVE affects all images using the Python's tarfile module. A specificlly crafted tar file which causes excessive
backtracking while tarfile parses headers is needed to exploit this vulnerability. If the vulnerability is exploited, it
can cause a denial of service attack. But from our product point of view, this risk of this vulnerability getting
exploited is very low. This is because it does not enable remote code execution. A user has to compromise of the images
using this library within python module and feed a specially crafted tar file and relies on the underlying system
processing that file, which limits the attack vector. A fix is not available at this time. We will upgrade the library
once the fix becomes available.
