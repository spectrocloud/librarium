## NIST CVE Summary

In SQLite 3.27.2, interleaving reads and writes in a single transaction with an fts5 virtual table will lead to a NULL Pointer Dereference in fts5ChunkIterate in sqlite3.c. This is related to ext/fts5/fts5_hash.c and ext/fts5/fts5_index.c.

## CVE Severity

[7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2019-9937)

## Our Official Summary

This vulnerability reported on sqlite can lead to information leaks. The images where this vulnrability is have controls in place are not accessible outside the cluster. So the attacker needs 
to gain privileged access to the cluster to attempt this exploit. Even then exploit is not easy because these containers do not allow execution of arbitrary code, which is necessary to exploit 
this. Impact of this exploit is also low, since these containers do not process any confidential information.
