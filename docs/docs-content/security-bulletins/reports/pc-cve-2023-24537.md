## NIST CVE Summary

Calling any of the Parse functions on Go source code which contains //line directives with very large line numbers can cause an infinite loop due to integer overflow.

## CVE Severity

[7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-24537)

## Our Official Summary

A flaw was found in Golang Go, where it is vulnerable to a denial of service caused by an infinite loop due to integer overflow when calling any of the Parse functions. By sending 
a specially crafted input, a remote attacker can cause a denial of service.

Exploiting this vulnerability in Palette deployments will require an external user to compromise the network controls and gain privileged access. There are controls in place which makes 
the exploitation difficult.
