## NIST CVE Summary

runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. In runc 1.1.11 and earlier, due to an internal file descriptor leak, an attacker could cause a newly-spawned container process (from runc exec) to have a working directory in the host filesystem namespace, allowing for a container escape by giving access to the host filesystem ("attack 2"). The same attack could be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to gain access to the host filesystem through runc run ("attack 1"). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could be also be used to overwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete container escapes ("attack 3a" and "attack 3b"). runc 1.1.12 includes patches for this issue. 

## CVE Severity

[8.6](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2024-21626)

## Our Official Summary

A file descriptor leak issue was found in the runc package. These vulnerabilities not only enable malicious actors to escape containerized environments but also allow for full control over the 
underlying host system. The presence of these dependencies in the container does not imply a security risk to the containerized application itself, as it is based on low-level packages included, 
and the impact to the container's core functionality is minimal.

Upstream fix from the 3rd party vendors is awaited. We will upgrade the images once the upstream fix becomes available.
