## CVE Details

[CVE-2023-0286](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0286)

## Last Update

11/7/24

## NIST CVE Summary

There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400
addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the
type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function
GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the
X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call,
enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to
provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only
controls one of these inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which
is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented their own
functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network.
