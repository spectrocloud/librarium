## CVE Details

[CVE-2023-0286](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0286)

## Last Update

## NIST CVE Summary

There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400
addresses were parsed as an ASN1\\\_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL\\\_NAME incorrectly specified
the type of the x400Address field as ASN1\\\_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function
GENERAL\\\_NAME\\\_cmp as an ASN1\\\_TYPE rather than an ASN1\\\_STRING.
