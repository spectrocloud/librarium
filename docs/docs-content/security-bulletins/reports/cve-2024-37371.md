## CVE Details

[CVE-2024-37371](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-37371)

## Last Update

10/29/2024

## NIST CVE Summary

In MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.21.3, an attacker can cause invalid memory reads during GSS message token handling
by sending message tokens with invalid length fields.

## Our Official Summary

This CVE is a memory corruption vulnerability reported on kerboros libraries. Attackers could potentially exploit a flaw
within Kerberos' handling of GSS (Generic Security Service) message tokens to cause invalid memory reads, potentially
leading to system crashes. This issue is classified as a moderate severity vulnerability because, while it allows an
attacker to modify the plaintext "Extra Count" field of a GSS krb5 wrap token, the impact is primarily limited to token
truncation at the application layer. This truncation can disrupt services but does not directly lead to a full
compromise of confidentiality or integrity. The attack requires that the attacker already has access to a valid token
transmission to modify, meaning it cannot be exploited remotely without first obtaining or intercepting a valid token.
We are waiting on an upstream fix from the 3rd party vendor and will upgrade the images once the upstream fix becomes
available.
