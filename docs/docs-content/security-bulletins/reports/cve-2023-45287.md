## CVE Details

[CVE-2023-45287](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45287)

## Last Update

11/7/2024

## NIST CVE Summary

Before Go 1.20, the RSA based TLS key exchanges used the math/big library, which is not constant time. RSA blinding was
applied to prevent timing attacks, but analysis shows this may not have been fully effective. In particular it appears
as if the removal of PKCS#1 padding may leak timing information, which in turn could be used to recover session key
bits. In Go 1.20, the crypto/tls library switched to a fully constant time RSA implementation, which we do not believe
exhibits any timing side channels.

## Our Official Summary

This vulnerability exists in older versions of Golang for RSA based TLS exchanges. All the images in which this is
detected are using older versions of Golang with updates available with a fix. In order to exploit the vulnerability,
attackers need to obtain privileged access to the cluster and handcraft specific calls to these containers. Images will
be upgraded to newer versions.
