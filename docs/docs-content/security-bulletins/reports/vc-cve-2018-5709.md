## NIST CVE Summary

An issue was discovered in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.16. There is a variable "dbentry-\>n_key_data" in kadmin/dbutil/dump.c that can store 16-bit data but unknowingly the developer has assigned a "u4" variable to it, which is for 32-bit data. An attacker can use this vulnerability to affect other artifacts of the database as we know that a Kerberos database dump file contains trusted data.

## CVE Severity

[7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2018-5709)

## Our Official Summary

An attacker can use this vulnerability to affect other artifacts of the database as we know that a Kerberos database dump file contains trusted data. The images where this vulnerability is have controls in place are not accessible outside the cluster. So the attacker needs to gain privileged access to the cluster to attempt this exploit. Also the 
containers do not allow execution of arbitrary code. Impact of this exploit is also low, since container reduces the attack surface.
