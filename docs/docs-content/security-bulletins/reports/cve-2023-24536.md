## CVE Details

[CVE-2023-24536](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24536)

## Last Update

## NIST CVE Summary

Multipart form parsing can consume large amounts of CPU and memory when processing form inputs containing very large
numbers of parts. This stems from several causes: 1. mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm limits the total memory a parsed
multipart form can consume. ReadForm can undercount the amount of memory consumed, leading it to accept larger inputs
than intended. 2. Limiting total memory does not account for increased pressure on the garbage collector from large
numbers of small allocations in forms with many parts. 3. ReadForm can allocate a large number of short-lived buffers,
further increasing pressure on the garbage collector. The combination of these factors can permit an attacker to cause
an program that parses multipart forms to consume large amounts of CPU and memory, potentially resulting in a denial of
service. This affects programs that use mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, as well as form parsing in the net/http package
with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. With fix, ReadForm now does a
better job of estimating the memory consumption of parsed forms, and performs many fewer short-lived allocations. In
addition, the fixed mime/multipart.Reader imposes the following limits on the size of parsed forms: 1. Forms parsed with
ReadForm may contain no more than 1000 parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable
GODEBUG=multipartmaxparts=. 2. Form parts parsed with NextPart and NextRawPart may contain no more than 10,000 header
fields. In addition, forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 10,000 header fields across all parts. This
limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxheaders=.

## Our Official Summary

Golang Go is vulnerable to a denial-of-service, caused by a flaw during multipart form parsing. By sending a specially
crafted input, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to consume large amounts of CPU and memory, and
results in a denial-of-service condition. The risk of this vulnerability exploited in our products is low. The images in
which this is reported will be upgraded to fix the issue.
