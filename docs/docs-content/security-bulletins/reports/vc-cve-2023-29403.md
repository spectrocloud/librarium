## Initial Publication

## Last Update

## Third Party Dependency 

go


## NIST CVE Summary

On Unix platforms, the Go runtime does not behave differently when a binary is run with the setuid/setgid bits. This can be dangerous in certain cases, such as when dumping memory state, or assuming the status of standard i/o file descriptors. If a setuid/setgid binary is executed with standard I/O file descriptors closed, opening any files can result in unexpected content being read or written with elevated privileges. Similarly, if a setuid/setgid program is terminated, either via panic or signal, it may leak the contents of its registers.

## CVE Severity

[7.8](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-29403)

## Our Official Summary

This vulnerability is reported on Go runtime in several older versions. Resources such as files and directories may be inadvertently exposed through mechanisms such as insecure permissions, or when a program accidentally operates on the wrong object.

The 3rd party images in which this vulnerability is reported will be upgrade as and when fixes are available. Risk of exploitation is low as the containers do not allow execution of arbitray code and remote code exploitation is not possible. Impact of exploitation is also low as container restricts the attack surface.
