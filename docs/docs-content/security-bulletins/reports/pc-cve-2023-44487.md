## Last Update

## NIST CVE Summary

The HTTP/2 protocol allows a denial of service (server resource consumption) because request cancellation can reset many streams quickly, as exploited in the wild in August through October 2023.

## CVE Severity

[7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-44487)

## Our Official Summary

In affected releases of gRPC-Go, it is possible for an attacker to send HTTP/2 requests, cancel them, and send subsequent requests, which is valid by the HTTP/2 protocol, but would cause the gRPC-Go server to launch more concurrent method handlers than the configured maximum stream limit.

The containers where this vulnerability is reported are internal components which requires privileged access and do not expose HTTP endpoints. So the risk of explotation is very low and impact is low as well because containers make the attack surface minimal. We will wait for upstream fixes for the libraries.
