## CVE Details

[CVE-2023-37920](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37920)

## Last Update

11/7/2024

## NIST CVE Summary

Certifi is a curated collection of Root Certificates for validating the trustworthiness of SSL certificates while
verifying the identity of TLS hosts. Certifi prior to version 2023.07.22 recognizes "e-Tugra" root certificates.
e-Tugra's root certificates were subject to an investigation prompted by reporting of security issues in their systems.
Certifi 2023.07.22 removes root certificates from "e-Tugra" from the root store.

## Our Official Summary

This vulnerability was found in the python-certifi package. eTurgra certificates are marked as untrusted by Mozilla and
were removed from Mozilla's root store in July 2023. This issue occurs when the e-Tugra root certificate in Certifi is
removed, resulting in an unspecified error that has an unknown impact and attack vector. This issue is mostly impacted
during the use of web browsers. The vulnerability exploitation likelihood in the calico cni images is low. We are
waiting on an upstream fix from the 3rd party vendors. We will upgrade the images once the upstream fix becomes
available.
