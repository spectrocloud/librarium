## CVE Details

[CVE-2022-3996](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3996)

## Last Update

10/14/24

## NIST CVE Summary

If an X.509 certificate contains a malformed policy constraint and policy processing is enabled, then a write lock will
be taken twice recursively. On some operating systems (most widely: Windows) this results in a denial of service when
the affected process hangs. Policy processing being enabled on a publicly facing server is not considered to be a common
setup. Policy processing is enabled by passing the
`-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function. Update
(31 March 2023): The description of the policy processing enablement was corrected based on CVE-2023-0466.
