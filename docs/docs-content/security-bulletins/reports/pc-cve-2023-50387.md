## NIST CVE Summary

Certain DNSSEC aspects of the DNS protocol (in RFC 4033, 4034, 4035, 6840, and related RFCs) allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via one or more DNSSEC responses, aka the "KeyTrap" issue. One of the concerns is that, when there is a zone with many DNSKEY and RRSIG records, the protocol specification implies that an algorithm must evaluate all combinations of DNSKEY and RRSIG records.

## CVE Severity

[7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-50387)

## Our Official Summary

This vulnerability in DNSSEC-validating resolvers is of important severity because it can lead to uncontrolled CPU consumption, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). By exploiting 
this flaw, attackers can send specially crafted DNS responses that cause the resolver to enter a state of excessive resource utilization. So the attacker needs to gain privileged 
access to the cluster to attempt this exploit. Also the containers do not allow execution of arbitrary code. Impact of this exploit is also low, since container reduces the attack surface.
