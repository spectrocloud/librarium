## CVE Details

[CVE-2023-5363](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-5363)

## Last Update

## NIST CVE Summary

Issue summary: A bug has been identified in the processing of key and initialisation vector (IV) lengths. This can lead
to potential truncation or overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers. Impact summary: A truncation in
the IV can result in non-uniqueness, which could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes. When calling
EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or EVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed after
the key and IV have been established. Any alterations to the key length, via the "keylen" parameter or the IV length,
via the "ivlen" parameter, within the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially causing truncation
or overreading of these values. The following ciphers and cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.
For the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in loss of confidentiality. For example, when
following NIST's SP 800-38D section 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in GCM mode, truncation
of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse. Both truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will
produce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory exception. However, these issues are not currently
assessed as security critical. Changing the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation and the
vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that application developers will have spotted this
problem during testing since decryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly vulnerable. For
these reasons we expect the probability of an application being vulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an
application is vulnerable then this issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed this issue as
Moderate severity overall. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1
FIPS providers are not affected by this because the issue lies outside of the FIPS provider boundary. OpenSSL 3.1 and
3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.
