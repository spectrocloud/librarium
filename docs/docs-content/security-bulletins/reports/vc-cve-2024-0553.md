## NIST CVE Summary

A vulnerability was found in GnuTLS. The response times to malformed ciphertexts in RSA-PSK ClientKeyExchange differ from the response times of ciphertexts with correct PKCS#1 v1.5 padding. This issue may allow a remote attacker to perform a timing side-channel attack in the RSA-PSK key exchange, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive data. CVE-2024-0553 is designated as an incomplete resolution for CVE-2023-5981.

## CVE Severity

[7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2024-0553)

## Our Official Summary

This vulnerability in GnuTLS, presents a moderate severity concern due to its potential for facilitating timing side-channel attacks in RSA-PSK ciphersuites. The images where this vulnerability is have controls in place are not accessible outside the cluster. So the attacker needs to gain privileged access to the cluster to attempt this exploit. Also the 
containers do not allow execution of arbitrary code. Impact of this exploit is also low, since container reduces the attack surface.
