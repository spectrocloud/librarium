## NIST CVE Summary

A buffer overflow was discovered in the GNU C Library's dynamic loader ld.so while processing the GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variable. This issue could allow a local attacker to use maliciously crafted GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variables when launching binaries with SUID permission to execute code with elevated privileges.

## CVE Severity

[7.8](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-4911)

## Our Official Summary

CVE-2023-4911:
This is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the dynamic loader’s handling of the GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variable poses significant risks to numerous Linux distributions. This environment variable, intended to fine-tune and optimize applications linked with glibc, is an essential tool for developers and system administrators. Its misuse or exploitation broadly affects system performance, reliability, and security. This vulnerability is part of the known exploited vulnerabilities released by CISA.

This vulnerability is reported on specific third-party optional images used in our products when particular features are enabled. Exploitation will require users to be authenticated with privileged
access. Containers in which these are reports have controls in place to prevent external code to be run making the explotation less likely. Impact of exploitation is also low as the attack surface of
the container is limited.
