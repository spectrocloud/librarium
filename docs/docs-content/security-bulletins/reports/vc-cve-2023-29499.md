## Initial Publication

10/25/2024

## Last Update

02/17/2025

## Third Party Dependency 

glib2


## NIST CVE Summary

A flaw was found in GLib. GVariant deserialization fails to validate that the input conforms to the expected format, leading to denial of service.

## CVE Severity

[7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-29499)

## Our Official Summary

This vulnerability enables a denial of service attack to be performed against applications that process untrusted GVariant input, compromising application availability by consuming excessive 
processing time or utilizing a large quantity of memory. Because the most widely available attack vector is local and the consequences are limited to denial of service.

The images where this vulnrability is have controls in place are not accessible outside the cluster. So the attacker needs to gain privileged access to the cluster to attempt this exploit. Also 
the containers do not allow execution of arbitrary code. Impact of this exploit is also low, since container reduces the attack surface.
