When parsing cookies that contained backslashes for quoted characters in the cookie value, the parser would use an algorithm with quadratic complexity, resulting in excess CPU resources being used while parsing the value.

The third party images in which this vulnerability is reported are serving html, so the risk of exploitation is very low. Impact of explotation is also low. We will look for upstream fixes to upgrade the images.
