## NIST CVE Summary

An issue in the Unmarshal function in Go-Yaml v3 causes the program to crash when attempting to deserialize invalid input.

## CVE Severity

[7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2022-28948)

## Our Official Summary

A flaw was found in the Unmarshal function in Go-Yaml. This vulnerability results in program crashes when attempting to convert (or deserialize) invalid input data, potentially impacting 
system stability and reliability.

The images where this vulnrability is have controls in place are not accessible outside the cluster. So the attacker needs to gain privileged access to the cluster to attempt this exploit. Also 
the containers do not allow execution of arbitrary code. Impact of this exploit is also low, since container reduces the attack surface.
