## Our Official Summary

This vulnerability is reported on some of the 3rd party csi images and coredns image from k8s. This CVE is of low risk for our products a network-based attack vector is 
simply impossible when it comes to golang code, apart from that as per CVE flaw analysis reported by golang, this only affects integrity and confidentiality and has no 
effect on availability. 

We will upgrade the images when the fixes are available from the upstream vendors.

| 01/11/2025 | Official summary revised: This vulnerability is a false positive. Although this is reported by the scanning tools on some of the components, further checks indicate the symbol/function with the vulnerability while present is not being used. |
| 12/16/2024 | Impacted versions changed from 4.5.4, 4.5.5, 4.5.8, 4.4.20, 4.5.10, 4.5.11 to 4.5.4, 4.5.5, 4.5.8, 4.4.20, 4.5.10, 4.5.11, 4.5.15 |
| 12/09/2024 | Official summary revised: This vulnerability is reported on some of the third party components. CVE flaw analysis reported by golang, states this function returns wrong information in some instances, and really doesnt compromise availability or confidentiality.This risk of exploitation for our products is very low. It requires attackers to execute code in the local context and requires privileged access. We will upgrade the images when the fixes are available from the upstream vendors. |

| 11/25/2024 | Official summary revised: This CVE identifies an integer overflow vulnerability found in libexpat versions prior to 2.6.3, specifically in thedtdCopy function of xmlparse.c on 32-bit platforms. This vulnerability can be exploited over a network without userinteraction and has very low attack complexity. Not all of the images affected use the specific function affected.Exploiting this vulnerable library will require a user to compromise the containers and gain privileged access. Fix isavailable in libexpat versions > 2.6.3. Investigating upgrading this library within the affected images. |

This CVE is of low risk for our products a network-based attack vector is simply impossible when it comes to golang code, apart from that as per CVE flaw analysis reported by golang, this only has very limited effect on  integrity and confidentiality and has no effect on availability. In order to exploit this, attacker need to get privilged access to the platform where these containers are running.  |
