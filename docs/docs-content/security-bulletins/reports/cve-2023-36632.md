## CVE Details

[CVE-2023-36632](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36632)

## Last Update

11/7/24

## NIST CVE Summary

The legacy email.utils.parseaddr function in Python through 3.11.4 allows attackers to trigger "RecursionError: maximum
recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object" via a crafted argument. This argument is plausibly an untrusted
value from an application's input data that was supposed to contain a name and an e-mail address. NOTE:
email.utils.parseaddr is categorized as a Legacy API in the documentation of the Python email package. Applications
should instead use the email.parser.BytesParser or email.parser.Parser class. NOTE: the vendor's perspective is that
this is neither a vulnerability nor a bug. The email package is intended to have size limits and to throw an exception
when limits are exceeded; they were exceeded by the example demonstration code.
