## NIST CVE Summary

A vulnerability was identified in the kjd/idna library, specifically within the \`idna.encode()\` function, affecting version 3.6. The issue arises from the function's handling of crafted input strings, which can lead to quadratic complexity and consequently, a denial of service condition. This vulnerability is triggered by a crafted input that causes the \`idna.encode()\` function to process the input with considerable computational load, significantly increasing the processing time in a quadratic manner relative to the input size.

## CVE Severity

[7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2024-3651)

## Our Official Summary

The idna package is a Python library that provides support for Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA). It
allows encoding and decoding of domain names containing non-ASCII characters. This vulnerability affects versions prior
to 3.7 of the idna package. Domain names cannot exceed 253 characters in length, so enforcing this limit can prevent the
resource consumption issue. However, this workaround may not be foolproof as it relies on the higher-level application
performing input validation. Upgrade the package to \> 3.7 version to fix the vulnerability.

Risk of exploitation of this vulnerability for our products is low, since accessing this command line utility requires attacker to have privileged access to the containers and do not allow arbitrary code to be run on them. Impact of exploitation is also low since containers have a limited attack surface. Third party containers in which this vulnerability is reported do not have an upstream fix. We will upgrade the images once the upstream fix becomes available.
