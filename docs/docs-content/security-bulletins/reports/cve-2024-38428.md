## CVE Details

[CVE-2024-38428](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38428)

## Last Update

8/16/2024

## NIST CVE Summary

Url.c in GNU Wget through 1.24.5 mishandles semicolons in the userinfo subcomponent of a URI, and thus there may be insecure behavior in which data that was supposed to be in the userinfo subcomponent is misinterpreted to be part of the host subcomponent.

## Our Official Summary

This is a critical severity vulnerability that affects any Wget version up to and including 1.24.5. Wget parses URIs in a way that causes userinfo to be considered part of the host if it contains a semicolon. This means that the host part of the URI could be interpreted incorrectly and be abused by attackers that control the userinfo. The CVE is only exploitable when a vulnerable Wget version is used in specific conditions. Risk of this vulnerability getting exploited in Spectro Cloud products is low. Need updates from the 3rd party vendor to fix the vulnerability.
