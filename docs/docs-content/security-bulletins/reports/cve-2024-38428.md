## CVE Details

[CVE-2024-38428](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38428)

## Last Update

10/10/2024

## NIST CVE Summary

Url.c in GNU Wget through 1.24.5 mishandles semicolons in the userinfo subcomponent of a URI, and thus there may be
insecure behavior in which data that was supposed to be in the userinfo subcomponent is misinterpreted to be part of the
host subcomponent.

## Our Official Summary

This is a critical severity vulnerability that affects any Wget version up to and including 1.24.5. `wget` parses URIs
in a way that causes user information to be considered part of the host if it contains a semicolon. This means that the
host part of the URI could be interpreted incorrectly and be abused by attackers that control the userinfo. The CVE is
only exploitable when a vulnerable `wget` version is used in specific conditions. Risk of this vulnerability getting
exploited in Spectro Cloud products is low. Need updates from the 3rd party vendor to fix the vulnerability.
