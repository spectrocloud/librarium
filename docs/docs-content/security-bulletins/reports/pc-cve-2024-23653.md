## NIST CVE Summary

BuildKit is a toolkit for converting source code to build artifacts in an efficient, expressive and repeatable manner. In addition to running containers as build steps, BuildKit also provides APIs for running interactive containers based on built images. It was possible to use these APIs to ask BuildKit to run a container with elevated privileges. Normally, running such containers is only allowed if special \`security.insecure\` entitlement is enabled both by buildkitd configuration and allowed by the user initializing the build request. The issue has been fixed in v0.12.5 . Avoid using BuildKit frontends from untrusted sources. 


## CVE Severity

[9.8](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2024-23653)

## Our Official Summary

A vulnerability was found in the Moby Builder Toolkit, specifically in the Interactive Containers API, where entitlement checks are not adequately validated, caused by a missing privilege check in 
a GRPC endpoint when called using a custom syntax format. This flaw allows the currently running privileged container to leverage its elevated privileges, such as full Linux capabilities, to break 
out of the container and achieve complete host root command execution. This issue may lead to container escape to the underlying host OS when building an image using a malicious Dockerfile or 
upstream image (for example, when using FROM).

A upstream fix for the 3rd party images is awaited. Will adopt the fixed version once it becomes available.
