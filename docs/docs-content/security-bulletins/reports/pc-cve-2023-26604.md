## NIST CVE Summary

systemd before 247 does not adequately block local privilege escalation for some Sudo configurations, e.g., plausible sudoers files in which the "systemctl status" command may be executed. Specifically, systemd does not set LESSSECURE to 1, and thus other programs may be launched from the less program. This presents a substantial security risk when running systemctl from Sudo, because less executes as root when the terminal size is too small to show the complete systemctl output.

## CVE Severity

[7.8](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-26604)

## Our Official Summary

A vulnerability was found in the systemd package. The systemd package does not adequately block local privilege escalation for some Sudo configurations, for example, plausible sudoers files, in which the "systemctl status" command may be executed. Specifically, systemd does not set LESSSECURE to 1, and thus other programs may be launched from the less program. This issue presents a substantial security risk when running systemctl from Sudo because less executes as root when the terminal size is too small to show the complete systemctl output.

| 12/12/2024 | Official summary revised: A vulnerability was found in the systemd package. The systemd package does not adequately block local privilege escalation for some Sudo configurations, for example, plausible sudoers files, in which the ""systemctl status"" command may be executed. Specifically, systemd does not set LESSSECURE to 1, and thus other programs may be launched from the less program. This issue presents a substantial security risk when running systemctl from Sudo because less executes as root when the terminal size is too small to show the complete systemctl output.This is reported on a few of the third party images for which an upstream fix is not available. Probability of exploitation is less likely as attackers need privileged access to thesecontainers and sufficient controls are in place to prevent that. We will wait for the upstream fix to become available. |
