## NIST CVE Summary

A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the __vsyslog_internal function of the glibc library. This function is called by the syslog and vsyslog functions. This issue occurs when the openlog function was not called, or called with the ident argument set to NULL, and the program name (the basename of argv[0]) is bigger than 1024 bytes, resulting in an application crash or local privilege escalation. This issue affects glibc 2.36 and newer.

## CVE Severity

[7.8](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-6246)

## Our Official Summary

This vulnerability is a heap based overflow in glib which affects version 2.36 and newer. Result of this exploit is an application crash or local privilege escalation. The images where this 
vulnrability is have controls in place are not accessible outside the cluster. So the attacker needs to gain privileged access to the cluster to attempt this exploit. Impact of this exploit 
is also low, since container reduces the attack surface.
