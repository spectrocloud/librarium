## NIST CVE Summary

GNU Libtasn1 before 4.19.0 has an ETYPE_OK off-by-one array size check that affects asn1_encode_simple_der.

## CVE Severity

[9.1](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2021-46848)

## Our Official Summary

This is a vulnerability reported in GNU Libtasn1 before version 4.19.0, a library used to manage the ASN.1 data structure. This vulnerability is caused by an off-by-one array size check issue, leading 
to an out-of-bounds read. Impacting systems are the ones using GNU Libtasn1 before 4.19.0. This flaw enables access to one additional memory byte, significantly constraining the potential damage an attacker could inflict. 

Risk of exploitation of this vulnerability for our products is low, since this requires attacker to have privileged access to the containers and do not allow arbitrary code to be run on them. Impact of exploitation is also low since containers have a limited attack surface. Third party containers in which this vulnerability is reported do not have an upstream fix. We will upgrade the images once the upstream fix becomes available.
