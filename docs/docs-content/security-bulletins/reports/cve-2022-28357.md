from a management account.

## Our Official Summary

A vulnerability was found in NATS nats-server up to 2.7.4. The product uses external input to construct a pathname that
is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product
does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location
that is outside of the restricted directory. Upgrade of the nats server is needed to fix this vulnerability.
