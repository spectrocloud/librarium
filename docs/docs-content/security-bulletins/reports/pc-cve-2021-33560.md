## Third Party Dependency 

libgcrypt20


## NIST CVE Summary

Libgcrypt before 1.8.8 and 1.9.x before 1.9.3 mishandles ElGamal encryption because it lacks exponent blinding to address a side-channel attack against mpi_powm, and the window size is not chosen appropriately. This, for example, affects use of ElGamal in OpenPGP.

## CVE Severity

[7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2021-33560)

## Our Official Summary

This flaw allows an attacker to decrypt parts of ciphertext encrypted using Elgamal, for example, when using OpenPGP. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.

Containers where this vulnerability is reported do not allow execution of arbitrary code and this cannot be exploited through remote execution. Even then risk of exploitation is low since 
containers restrict the attack surface.
