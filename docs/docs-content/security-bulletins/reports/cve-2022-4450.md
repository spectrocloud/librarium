## CVE Details

[CVE-2022-4450](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-4450)

## Last Update

7/16/2024

## NIST CVE Summary

The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes the "name" (e.g. "CERTIFICATE"), any
header data and the payload data. If the function succeeds then the "name_out", "header" and "data" arguments are
populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those
buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex()
will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed.
If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash.
