## NIST CVE Summary

Templates do not properly consider backticks (\`) as Javascript string delimiters, and do not escape them as expected. Backticks are used, since ES6, for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. "var a = \{\{.\}\}"), since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template.Parse returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported, but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21. Users who rely on the previous behavior can re-enable it using the GODEBUG flag jstmpllitinterp=1, with the caveat that backticks will now be escaped. This should be used with caution.

## CVE Severity

[9.8](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-24538)

## Our Official Summary

This vulnerability is reported on several of the 3rd party cni images used by our products such as calico and
multus-cni. The out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Bzip2 libraries can be exploited by a malicious bzip2 payload,
potentially resulting in a denial of service or remote code execution. Network services or command line utilities that
decompress untrusted bzip2 payloads are at risk. The risk scenario is low for the following reasons: These images are
optional and will be installed depending on the configuration of the deployments; there are no known reports of
exploitation from the 3rd party vendors; and these images are not accessible directly for an attacker to send crafted
input. We will upgrade the images when the fixes become available from the vendors.
