## CVE Details

[CVE-2023-24534](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24534)

## Last Update

10/10/2024

## NIST CVE Summary

HTTP and MIME header parsing can allocate large amounts of memory, even when parsing small inputs, potentially leading
to a denial of service. Certain unusual patterns of input data can cause the common function used to parse HTTP and MIME
headers to allocate substantially more memory than required to hold the parsed headers. An attacker can exploit this
behavior to cause an HTTP server to allocate large amounts of memory from a small request, potentially leading to memory
exhaustion and a denial of service. With fix, header parsing now correctly allocates only the memory required to hold
parsed headers.

## Our Official Summary

This CVE involves excessive memory allocation in net/http and net/textproto, potentially leading to a denial-of-service
due to large memory allocation while parsing HTTP and MIME headers even for small inputs. Attackers can exploit this
vulnerability to exhaust an HTTP server's memory resources, causing a denial of service. By crafting specific input data
patterns, an attacker can trigger the excessive memory allocation behavior in the HTTP and MIME header parsing
functions, leading to memory exhaustion. The risk of this vulnerability exploited in Spectro Cloud products is very low.
3rd party images affected will be upgraded to remove the vulnerability.
