## CVE Details

[CVE-2023-24534](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24534)

## Last Update

09/15/2024

## NIST CVE Summary

HTTP and MIME header parsing can allocate large amounts of memory, even when parsing small inputs, potentially leading
to a denial of service. Certain unusual patterns of input data can cause the common function used to parse HTTP and MIME
headers to allocate substantially more memory than required to hold the parsed headers. An attacker can exploit this
behavior to cause an HTTP server to allocate large amounts of memory from a small request, potentially leading to memory
exhaustion and a denial of service. With fix, header parsing now correctly allocates only the memory required to hold
parsed headers.
