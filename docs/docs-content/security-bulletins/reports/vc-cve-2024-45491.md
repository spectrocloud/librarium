## Third Party Dependency 

libexpat


## NIST CVE Summary

An issue was discovered in libexpat before 2.6.3. dtdCopy in xmlparse.c can have an integer overflow for nDefaultAtts on 32-bit platforms (where UINT_MAX equals SIZE_MAX).

## CVE Severity

[9.8](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2024-45491)

## Our Official Summary

This CVE identifies an integer overflow vulnerability found in libexpat versions prior to 2.6.3, specifically in the dtdCopy function of xmlparse.c on 32-bit platforms. This vulnerability 
can be exploited over a network without user interaction and has very low attack complexity. Not all of the images affected use the specific functions affected. 

Exploiting this vulnerability in Palette deployments will require an external user to compromise the network controls and gain privileged access. There are controls in place which makes 
the exploitation difficult. Fix is available in libexpat versions \> 2.6.3. Once the fixed version of the library is adoped by 3rd party images, we will incorporate those in our products.
