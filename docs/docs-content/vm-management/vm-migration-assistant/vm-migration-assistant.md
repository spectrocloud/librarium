During large scale Kubernetes adoptions, workloads are often rehosted or migrated instead of being redeployed from
scratch. This process allows system administrators to copy the application, together with its data, to a Kubernetes
cluster. However, the migration of Virtual Machines (VMs) can be time consuming if done manually, so it is often
automated with open source tools such as [Forklift](https://github.com/kubev2v/forklift).

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

Palette provides the ability to migrate VMs from VMware vSphere to Virtual Machine Orchestrator (VMO) using the Virtual Machine Migration Assistant (VM Migration Assistant).
The <VersionedLink text="VM Migration Assistant" url="/integrations/packs/?pack=vm-migration-assistant"/> is an
add-on pack that can be added to your cluster profile and works alongside the
<VersionedLink text="VMO" url="/integrations/packs/?pack=virtual-machine-orchestrator" /> pack.

## Limitations

- You can only migrate VMs hosted in VMware vSphere 7.0 and 8.0.
- Only VMs whose operating systems are included under
  [`virt-v2v` supported guest systems](https://libguestfs.org/virt-v2v-support.1.html) can be migrated.

- Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) files are not supported as a provider type for migrations.

## Verified Migrations

The following table lists `virt-v2v` migration combinations verified by Spectro Cloud. Other combinations may be valid
but have not been verified.
