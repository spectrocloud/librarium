Follow this guide to start migration plans in the VM Migration Assistant.

## Start Cold Migration Plans

### Limitations

- You can migrate only VMs hosted in VMware vSphere 7.0 or 8.0.

- You can migrate only VMs whose operating systems are present in the
  [`virt-v2v` supported guest systems](https://libguestfs.org/virt-v2v-support.1.html) list. Refer to
  [Verified Migrations](./vm-migration-assistant.md#verified-migrations) for a list of operating systems and migration
  combinations verified by Spectro Cloud.

- If you are migrating more than one VM in the same plan, they must all share the same network.

### Prerequisites

- A cold migration plan created and ready to start. Refer to [Create Migration Plans](./create-migration-plans.md) for
  guidance.

- One or more VMs hosted in VMware vSphere.

- VMs operating Windows must be shut down at the virtualized OS level.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

- The <VersionedLink text="Virtual Machine Migration Assistant" url="/integrations/packs/?pack=vm-migration-assistant"/> pack must be added to your cluster profile. Refer to [Create a VM Migration Assistant Cluster Profile](./create-vm-migration-assistant-profile.md) for guidance.

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

- The VM Migration Assistant service console must be accessible from a web browser.

### Start Cold Migration

1. [Access the VM Migration Assistant service console](./create-vm-migration-assistant-profile.md#access-the-vm-migration-assistant-service-console).

2. From the left **Main Menu**, select **Plans for virtualization**.

3. In the top-left corner, use the **Namespace** drop-down Menu to select your Kubernetes namespace for the migration.

4. Find your plan in the table and click the plan name to view its details.

5. Click **Start migration** in the top-right corner.

6. Click **Start** in the pop-up window.

7. Click on the **Virtual Machines** tab.

8. In the table, view the status of the migration for each VM in the **Pipeline status** column. Each circle represents
   a stage in the migration. You can click on a circle to view additional details.

   ![Pipeline Status](/vm-management_vm-migration-assistant_migrate-vms-vmo-cluster_pipeline-status-cold.webp)

   View additional pipeline details by clicking on the **>** icon next to the VM name.

### Validate

1. [Access the VM Migration Assistant service console](./create-vm-migration-assistant-profile.md#access-the-vm-migration-assistant-service-console).

2. From the left **Main Menu**, select **Plans for virtualization**.

3. In the top-left corner, use the **Namespace** drop-down Menu to select your Kubernetes namespace for the migration.

4. In the table, click on a plan name to view the plan details.

5. In the **Details** tab, the plan status displays as **Successful**.

6. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com).

7. From the left **Main Menu**, select **Clusters**. Then, choose the VMO cluster that you migrated your VMs to. The
   **Overview** tab appears.

8. Select the **Virtual Machines** tab. Then, select your migration namespace from the **Namespace** drop-down Menu.
   Your migrated VMs appear.

9. For each migrated VM, click on the **three-dot Menu** and select **Start**. Your VMs are now ready to use.

## Start Warm Migration Plans

### Limitations

- You can migrate only VMs hosted in VMware vSphere 7.0 or 8.0.

- You can migrate only VMs whose operating systems are present in the
  [`virt-v2v` supported guest systems](https://libguestfs.org/virt-v2v-support.1.html) list. Refer to
  [Verified Migrations](./vm-migration-assistant.md#verified-migrations) for a list of operating systems and migration
  combinations verified by Spectro Cloud.

- If you are migrating more than one VM in the same plan, they must all share the same network.

### Prerequisites

- A warm migration plan created and ready to start. Refer to [Create Migration Plans](./create-migration-plans.md) for
  guidance.

- [Changed Block Tracking](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/315370/enabling-or-disabling-changed-block-trac.html)
  must be enabled on your VMs.

- Terminal access to execute [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) commands on your VMO cluster.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

- The <VersionedLink text="Virtual Machine Migration Assistant" url="/integrations/packs/?pack=vm-migration-assistant"/> pack must be added to your cluster profile. Refer to [Create a VM Migration Assistant Cluster Profile](./create-vm-migration-assistant-profile.md) for guidance.

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

- The VM Migration Assistant service console must be accessible from a web browser.

### Start Warm Migration

1. [Access the VM Migration Assistant service console](./create-vm-migration-assistant-profile.md#access-the-vm-migration-assistant-service-console).

2. From the left **Main Menu**, select **Plans for virtualization**.

3. In the top-left corner, use the **Namespace** drop-down Menu to select your Kubernetes namespace for the migration.

4. Find your plan in the table and click the plan name to view its details.

5. Click **Start migration** in the top-right corner.

6. Click **Start** in the pop-up window.

7. Click on the **Virtual Machines** tab.

8. In the table, view the status of the migration for each VM in the **Pipeline status** column. Each circle represents
   a stage in the migration. You can click on a circle to view additional details.

   ![Pipeline Status](/vm-management_vm-migration-assistant_migrate-vms-vmo-cluster_pipeline-status-warm.webp)

   View additional pipeline details by clicking on the **>** icon next to the VM name.

   ![Pipeline Details](/vm-management_vm-migration-assistant_migrate-vms-vmo-cluster_pipeline-details-warm.webp)

9. Open a terminal session and
   [configure access](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/)
   to your VMO cluster.

10. Issue the following command to check for [datavolumes](https://kubevirt.io/2018/CDI-DataVolumes.html) in your chosen
    VM migration namespace.

    ```shell
    kubectl get datavolume --namespace <myVmMigrationNamespace>
    ```

    Example output.

    ```shell
    NAME                                PHASE         PROGRESS   AGE
    vm-migration-cold-vm-140860-92mwk  Succeeded     100%       30m
    vm-migration-warm-vm-140852-p446x  Importing     75%        20m
    ```

    The data volume names are uniquely generated using the `<planName>-<vmIdentifier>-<randomSuffix>` template.

11. Issue the following command to output the data volume details to your terminal.

    ```shell
    kubectl describe datavolume <datavolumeName> --namespace <myVmMigrationNamespace>
    ```

    When the status of the volume is paused and awaiting cutover, the warm migration is ready for the final cutover.

12. Return to the VM Migration Assistant.

13. On the **Virtual Machines** tab for your plan, click the **Actions** drop-down Menu in the top-right corner.

14. Click **Cutover**.

15. In the pop-up window, click on the calendar icon and select a cutover date in the calendar. Next, click on the clock
    icon and select a cutover time from the drop-down Menu.

16. Click **Set cutover** once complete.

When the cutover is initiated, the source VM is powered off, and a final synchronization of remaining disk changes is
completed. The target VM is then created and powered on on the destination VMO cluster.

### Validate

1. [Access the VM Migration Assistant service console](./create-vm-migration-assistant-profile.md#access-the-vm-migration-assistant-service-console).

2. From the left **Main Menu**, select **Plans for virtualization**.

3. In the top-left corner, use the **Namespace** drop-down Menu to select your Kubernetes namespace for the migration.

4. In the table, click on a plan name to view the plan details.

5. In the **Details** tab, the plan status displays as **Successful**.

6. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com).

7. From the left **Main Menu**, select **Clusters**. Then, choose the VMO cluster that you migrated your VMs to. The
   **Overview** tab appears.

8. Select the **Virtual Machines** tab. Then, select your migration namespace from the **Namespace** drop-down Menu.
   Your migrated VMs appear with a **Running** status.
