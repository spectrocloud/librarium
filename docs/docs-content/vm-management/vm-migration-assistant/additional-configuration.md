| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Max concurrent virtual machine migrations** | The maximum number of VMs per plan that can be migrated simultaneously.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | `20`          |
| **Controller main container CPU limit**       | The CPU limit (in milliCPU) allocated to the main container in the controller pod.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | `500m`        |
| **Controller main container Memory limit**    | The Memory limit (in mebibytes) allocated to the main container in the controller pod.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | `800Mi`       |
| **Precopy interval (minutes)**                | _(Only applicable to warm migrations)_ The interval time at which a new snapshot is requested prior to initiating a warm migration. The optimal choice depends on various factors such as network bandwidth and the rate of data changes. For example, VMs with heavy write workloads benefit from shorter intervals. | `60`          |
| **Snapshot polling interval (seconds)**       | _(Only applicable to warm migrations)_ The frequency at which the migration controller checks for changes or updates in snapshots during the migration process. Shorter frequencies may reduce the overall migration time, but will also increase resource usage.                                                     | `10`          |

You can configure the migration network for each listed host in the table.

:::info

Using the default management network for migration can lead to poor performance. Disk transfer operations may saturate
may saturate network bandwidth, which could affect communication between vCenter and ESXi hosts.

A dedicated migration network can improve performance and reduce risks to the VMware environment.

:::

#### Configure Provider Host Network

1. For each host that you want to configure, click the checkbox next to the hosts' name.
2. Click on **Select migration network**.
3. The configurable settings are described in the following table.
