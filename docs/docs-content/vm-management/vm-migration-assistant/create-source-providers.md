Follow this guide to create source providers using the VM Migration Assistant. Source providers host the Virtual
Machines (VMs) that need to be migrated.

## Limitations

- You can only migrate VMs hosted in VMware vSphere 7.0 and 8.0.
- Only VMs whose operating systems are included under
  [`virt-v2v` supported guest systems](https://libguestfs.org/virt-v2v-support.1.html) can be migrated. Refer to
  [Verified Migrations](./vm-migration-assistant.md#verified-migrations) for a list of operating systems and migration
  combinations verified by Spectro Cloud.

- Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) files are not supported as a provider type for migrations.

## Prerequisites

<!--prettier-ignore-->
- The <VersionedLink text="Virtual Machine Migration Assistant" url="/integrations/packs/?pack=vm-migration-assistant"/> pack must be added to your cluster profile. Refer to [Create a VM Migration Assistant Cluster Profile](./create-vm-migration-assistant-profile.md) for guidance.
  - The VM Migration Assistant service console must be accessible from a web browser.

- A healthy Virtual Machine Orchestrator (VMO) cluster. Refer to the [Create a VMO Profile](../create-vmo-profile.md) for further guidance.

  - The VMO cluster must have network connectivity to vCenter and ESXi hosts, and the VMs you want to migrate.

- A vCenter user account with the following necessary privileges to perform migrations.
  
  | **Privileges**                                      | **Description**                   |
  |----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | [**Virtual Machine Interaction Privileges** (all)](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere/8-0/vsphere-security-8-0/defined-privileges/virtual-machine-interaction-privileges.html) | Allow creating, cloning, modifying, customizing, and managing templates, virtual machines, their files, and customization specifications, as well as performing disk and deployment-related operations. |
  | **[Virtual machine.Snapshot management.Create snapshot](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere/8-0/vsphere-security-8-0/defined-privileges/virtual-machine-snapshot-management-privileges.html)** | Allows capturing the current state of a virtual machine as a snapshot.  |
  | **[Virtual machine.Snapshot management.Remove Snapshot](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere/8-0/vsphere-security-8-0/defined-privileges/virtual-machine-snapshot-management-privileges.html)** | Permits deletion of a snapshot from the snapshot history.    |

  - Migrations can be optionally accelerated by providing credentials for the ESXi hosts where the VMs reside.

- One or more VMs hosted in VMware vSphere. Only VMs whose operating systems are included under
  [`virt-v2v` supported guest systems](https://libguestfs.org/virt-v2v-support.1.html) can be migrated.

  - If you are migrating more than one VM in the same plan, they must all share the same network.
  - For cold migrations, ensure that VMs operating Windows are shut down at the guest OS level.
  - For warm migrations,
    [Changed Block Tracking](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/315370/enabling-or-disabling-changed-block-trac.html)
    must be enabled on your VMs.

- We recommend providing a
  [VMware Virtual Disk Development Kit (VDDK) image](https://developer.broadcom.com/sdks/vmware-virtual-disk-development-kit-vddk/latest)
  for the migration. This will significantly speed up the migration. The migration engine uses VDDK on the destination VMO cluster to read virtual disks from the source environment, transfer the data, and write it to the target storage.

  - You must build and host the VDDK image in your own image registry, which must be accessible to the destination VMO cluster for migrations.

    <summary> Example steps to build and upload VDDK image </summary>

    <Tabs>

    <TabItem label="Non-Airgap" value="non-airgap">

    1. Download the VDDK image from the
       [Broadcom Developer Portal](https://developer.broadcom.com/sdks/vmware-virtual-disk-development-kit-vddk/latest).

    2. Decompress the downloaded image.

       ```shell
       tar -xzf VMware-vix-disklib-<version>.x86_64.tar.gz
       ```

    3. Create a Dockerfile to build the VDDK image.

       ```shell
       cat > Dockerfile <<EOF
       FROM <myregistry/myrepository:tag>
       USER 1001
       COPY vmware-vix-disklib-distrib /vmware-vix-disklib-distrib
       RUN mkdir -p /opt
       ENTRYPOINT ["cp", "-r", "/vmware-vix-disklib-distrib", "/opt"]
       EOF
       ```

       Replace the `<myregistry/myrepository:tag>` with your chosen base image registry, repository, and tag (for example: `ubuntu:22.04`).

    4. Build the image.

       ```shell
       docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --tag <docker-registry>/vddk:<tag> .
       ```

    5. Push the built image to your image registry.

       ```shell
       docker push <docker-registry>/vddk:<tag>
       ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Airgap" value="airgap">

    1. Download the VDDK image from the
       [Broadcom Developer Portal](https://developer.broadcom.com/sdks/vmware-virtual-disk-development-kit-vddk/latest).

    2. Copy or move the VDDK image to another Linux environment inside your airgap environment. Use any approved method to transfer the binary to the airgap environment.

    3. Log in to the Linux environment inside your airgap environment where you copied the VDDK image.

    4. Decompress the downloaded image.

       ```shell
       tar -xzf VMware-vix-disklib-<version>.x86_64.tar.gz
       ```

    5. Create a Dockerfile to build the VDDK image.

       ```shell
       cat > Dockerfile <<EOF
       FROM <myregistry/myrepository:tag>
       USER 1001
       COPY vmware-vix-disklib-distrib /vmware-vix-disklib-distrib
       RUN mkdir -p /opt
       ENTRYPOINT ["cp", "-r", "/vmware-vix-disklib-distrib", "/opt"]
       EOF
       ```

       Replace the `<myregistry/myrepository:tag>` with your chosen base image registry, repository, and tag (for example: `ubuntu:22.04`).

    6. Authenticate with your OCI registry. The following examples are for Harbor and AWS ECR.

       <Tabs groupId="oci-registry">

       <TabItem label="Harbor" value="harbor">

       Use `oras` to log in to your OCI registry. Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your registry credentials, and replace `<harbor-address>` with your Harbor hostname / IP address.
       Check out the [oras login](https://oras.land/docs/commands/oras_login) documentation for information about
       additional CLI flags and examples.

       ```shell
       oras login <harbor-address> --username '<username>' --password '<password>'
       ```

       If you are using a Harbor registry with a self-signed certificate, you will need to add the `--insecure` flag to the
       `oras` command.

       ```shell
       oras login <harbor-address> --insecure --username '<username>' --password '<password>'
       ```

       </TabItem>

       <TabItem label="AWS ECR" value="aws-ecr">

       You can acquire the AWS ECR authentication command from the AWS ECR console. From the ECR repository details page,
       click on the **View push commands** button to access the command. Refer to the
       [AWS ECR Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/getting-started-cli.html#cli-authenticate-registry)
       documentation for more information.

       Use the following command to authenticate with AWS ECR. The output of the `aws` command is passed to `oras` to
       authenticate with the ECR registry. Replace `<username>` with your registry username and `<aws-ecr-url>` with your registry URL. Enter your registry password when prompted.

       ```shell
       aws ecr get-login-password --region xxxxx | oras login --username <username> --password-stdin <aws-ecr-url>
       ```

       For a public image repository, use the `docker` CLI instead of using `oras`. Replace `<username>` with your registry username and `<aws-ecr-url>` with your registry URL. Enter your registry password when prompted.

       ```shell
       aws ecr-public get-login-password --region xxxxx | docker login --username <username> --password-stdin <aws-ecr-url>
       ```

       </TabItem>

       </Tabs>

    7. Build the image.

       <Tabs groupId="oci-registry">

       <TabItem label="Harbor" value="harbor">

       Replace `<harbor-address>` with your Harbor hostname / IP address, `<project-name>` with the target project name in Harbor, and `<tag>` with your chosen image tag.

       ```shell
       docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --tag <harbor-address>/<project-name>/vddk:<tag> .
       ```

       </TabItem>

       <TabItem label="AWS ECR" value="aws-ecr">

       Replace `<aws-ecr-url>` with your registry URL and `<tag>` with your chosen image tag.

       ```shell
       docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --tag <aws-ecr-url>:<tag> .
       ```

       </TabItem>

       </Tabs>

    8. Push the built image to your image registry.

       <Tabs groupId="oci-registry">

       <TabItem label="Harbor" value="harbor">

       Replace `<harbor-address>` with your Harbor hostname / IP address, `<project-name>` with the target project name in Harbor, and `<tag>` with your chosen image tag.

       ```shell
       docker push <harbor-address>/<project-name>/vddk:<tag>
       ```

       </TabItem>

       <TabItem label="AWS ECR" value="aws-ecr">

       Replace `<aws-ecr-url>` with your registry URL and `<tag>` with your chosen image tag.

       ```shell
       docker push <aws-ecr-url>:<tag>
       ```

       </TabItem>

       </Tabs>

    </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

    </details>

  - If you are using a private image registry, you must create a Secret to be used for the migration. The Secret must be
    created in the namespace where the VMs will be migrated to, and the `metadata.name` value must be
    `vddk-image-pull-secret`.

    <!--prettier-ignore-->
    <details>
    <summary> Example Secret Creation </summary>

    A Secret can be created by issuing the following command.

    ```shell
    kubectl create secret docker-registry vddk-image-pull-secret \
    --docker-server=myRegistryServer \
    --docker-username=myUsername \
    --docker-password=myPassword \
    --docker-email=myEmail \
    --kubeconfig=/path/to/myKubeconfig \
    --namespace=myVmMigrationNamespace \
    --output yaml
    ```

    This creates the Secret named `vddk-image-pull-secret` in your destination cluster under the namespace provided.
    Ensure that this namespace matches the one you have chosen for the VM migration.

    ```yaml hideClipboard
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: vddk-image-pull-secret
    data:
      .dockerconfigjson: #base64 encoded dockerconfigjson
    type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
    ```

    The `data.dockerconfigjson` value contains your registry credentials, which have been base64 encoded by the command.

    Alternatively, you can manually encode a `config.json` by issuing the following command.

    ```shell
    cat path/to/config.json | base64 --wrap=0
    ```

    ```text hideClipboard title="Example output"
    eyJodHRwczovL2luZGV4L ... J0QUl6RTIifX0=
    ```

    You can then use this output to create your own Secret manually. Ensure that the `metadata.name` is set to
    `vddk-image-pull-secret`.

    Refer to the
    [Pull an Image from a Private Registry](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/)
    and
    [kubectl create secret docker-registry](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_create/kubectl_create_secret_docker-registry/)
    documentation for additional guidance.

   | **Convert Disk**                | When enabled, disk conversion is handled using virt-v2v. For example, if you're migrating from VMware vSphere to VMO, virt-v2v can convert Virtual Machine Disk (VMDK) to raw or QEMU copy-on-write version 2 (qcow2) formats that are optimal for the target environment.                                                                                    |
