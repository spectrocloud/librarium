Access to the Virtual Machines (VM) is governed by Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). You must create roles and role
bindings and role bindings and assign them to users before they are allowed to create or manage VMs.

To get started, review [VM Roles and Permissions](./vm-roles-permissions.md) and learn about the default roles and the
available permissions. Then, refer to [Add Roles and Role Bindings](./add-roles-and-role-bindings.md) to learn how to
assign roles and role bindings to users.
