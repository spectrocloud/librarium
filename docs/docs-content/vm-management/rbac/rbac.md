Access to the Virtual Machines (VM) is governed by Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). You must create roles and role
bindings and assign them to users before they are allowed to create or manage VMs.

To get started, review [VM Roles and Permissions](./vm-roles-permissions.md) and learn about the default roles and the
available permissions. Then, refer to [Add Roles and Role Bindings](./add-roles-and-role-bindings.md) to learn how to
assign roles and role bindings to users.
