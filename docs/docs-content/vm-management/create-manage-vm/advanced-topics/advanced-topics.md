Beyond the standard Virtual Machine (VM) operations such as deployment, clone, and migration, Palette Virtual Machine
Orchestrator (VMO) supports further customization and advanced use cases.

This section discusses advanced topics such as creating and modifying VM template and disk templates. You will also
learn how to perform standard VM operations via the command-line tool, virtctl, and how to maximize your VM performance
by over-committing CPU and memory.
