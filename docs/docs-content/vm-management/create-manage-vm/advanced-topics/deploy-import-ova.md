VMware vSphere Virtual Machines (VMs) can be exported using the Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) format. This allows users
to share configurations and create templates for their VMs. These important templates need to be converted into
Kubernetes compatible formats before they can be used in a Kubernetes cluster.

The [Palette CLI](../../../automation/palette-cli/palette-cli.md) provides the ability to import and deploy OVAs to
Palette VMO.

## Limitations

- Only OVAs whose operating systems are included under
  [`virt-v2v` supported guest systems](https://libguestfs.org/virt-v2v-support.1.html) can be imported.

## Prerequisites

- A Healthy VMO cluster. Refer to the [Create a VMO Profile](../../create-vmo-profile.md) for further guidance.

  - Ensure that your VMO cluster has sufficient capacity for any VMs that you deploy. Refer to the
    [Environment Setup](../../environment-setup.md) page for recommended environment sizes.

:::warning

If you need to provision `Block` storage volumes during the VM deployment process, add the following custom
configuration to your VMO cluster OS pack. Applying this configuration may cause a cluster repave. For more information,
refer to
[Repave Behaviors and Configurations](../../../clusters/cluster-management/node-pool.md#repave-behavior-and-configuration)

Additionally, we recommend provisioning volumes with the `ReadWriteMany` access mode to ensure that VMs can be
[live migrated](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/compute/live_migration/#limitations).

```

If you are in a proxied environment, you must configure the
[Containerized Data Importer](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/storage/containerized_data_importer/) (CDI) custom resource
in order to deploy to a `DataVolume`. Refer to the
[CDI Configuration](https://github.com/kubevirt/containerized-data-importer/blob/main/doc/cdi-config.md#options)
documentation.

If you have configured Nginx together with MetalLB, add an entry to `/etc/hosts` that maps the CDI upload proxy host
name, for example `cdi-uploadproxy.mycompany.io`, to the Nginx load balancerâ€™s public IP address.

:::

- Install kubectl command-line tool. Refer to the
  [kubectl installation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) guide to learn more.
- Install the virtctl command-line tool. Refer to the
  [virtctl installation](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/user_workloads/virtctl_client_tool/) guide for more information.

## Enablement

1. Download the [Kubeconfig](../../../clusters/cluster-management/kubeconfig.md) file of the VMO cluster.

2. Open a terminal window and set the environment variable `KUBECONFIG` to point to the file you downloaded.

   ```shell
   export KUBECONFIG=<path-to-kubeconfig-file>
   ```

3. Execute the following command in your terminal. It creates a dedicated VM inside your VMO cluster which contains all
   the tools required for OVA import and deployment. The VM is named `vmo-jh`.

   ```shell
   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply --filename -

   ```

   :::info

   Depending on the configuration of your VMO cluster's CSI layer, you may need to change the configured `ReadWriteMany`
   access mode to `ReadWriteOnce`. Check the documentation for your chosen CSI to ensure you have the correct setting.

   :::

4. The VM provisioning and start up process will take a few minutes to complete. Execute the following command to check
   the status of your VMs.

   ```shell
   kubectl get vms --all-namespaces
   ```

   The `vmo-jh` VM appears in the state `Running` when it is ready for usage.

   ```shell hideClipboard
   NAMESPACE              NAME                                 AGE     STATUS          READY
   default                vmo-jh                               6m16s   Running         True
   ```

5. The VM is created with the `Welcome@123` default password and is accessible through your cluster's kubeconfig file.
   You can secure access to the cluster by uploading a public key to the VM and adding it as an authorized key. You will
   then need to supply the corresponding private key when connecting to the VM.

   ```shell
   virtctl scp public-key.pub root@vmo-jh.default:/root

   virtctl ssh root@vmo-jh.default --local-ssh=true

   mkdir -p /root/.ssh && cat /root/public-key.pub >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```

   :::info

   If you are starting an SSH session from a Windows machine, then you should omit the `--local-ssh=true` flag and
   execute the command `virtctl ssh root@vmo-jh.default` only.

   :::

6. Copy your cluster's kubeconfig file to the VM. Replace the placeholders with local path to the kubeconfig file and
   the path to your private key. The kubeconfig file is required for subsequent operations.

   ```shell
   virtctl scp <path-to-downloaded-kubeconfig-file> --identity-file <path-to-private-key> root@vmo-jh.default:/root
   ```

7. Download the newest [Palette CLI](../../../spectro-downloads.md#palette-cli) binary. Copy the binary to the VM, in
   the same way you copied the kubeconfig file. Replace the placeholders with local path to the downloaded binary and
   the path to your private key.

   ```shell
   virtctl scp <path-to-downloaded-palette-cli-binary> --identity-file <path-to-private-key> root@vmo-jh.default:/root
   ```

8. Start an SSH session with the VM.

   ```shell
   virtctl ssh --identity-file <path-to-private-key> root@vmo-jh.default --local-ssh=true
   ```

9. Download an OVA file to import on the VM. Alternatively, you can upload the OVA file using `virtctl scp` as
   demonstrated in previous steps. This guide uses a publicly available Bitnami image for demonstration purposes.

   ```shell
   curl --location https://downloads.bitnami.com/files/stacks/wordpress/6.2.2/bitnami-wordpress-6.2.2-r1-debian-11-amd64.ova --output bitnami-wordpress-6.2.2-r1-debian-11-amd64.ova
   ```

10. Set the environment variable `KUBECONFIG` to point to the file you uploaded. This allows your terminal session to
    connect to your VMO cluster.

    ```shell
    export KUBECONFIG=<path-to-kubeconfig-file>
    ```

11. Execute the following command to start an interactive shell and begin the import process.

    ```shell
    palette vmo import-ova
    ```

    :::tip

    You can save your configuration to a file, allowing you to revise your configuration and perform the import later.

    ```shell
    palette vmo import-ova --config-only
    ```

    :::

    The Palette CLI prompts you for information regarding the OVA you want to import.

    | **Access Mode for the PVC**                 | Set the access mode for your `DataVolume`. Ensure that your configured CSI supports your selection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | `ReadWriteMany` / `ReadWriteOnce` |

    | **CDI Upload Proxy URL**                    | Optionally provide a custom CDI upload proxy URL. If ingress is configured for the CDI upload proxy, the ingress hostname will be used by default and must be resolvable via DNS. If the CDI upload proxy is exposed via a NodePort, a node IP and ephemeral port will be used. Depending on how CDI and DNS are configured, you may need to edit `/etc/hosts` to ensure DNS resolution. You may also port-forward the CDI upload proxy via `kubectl --namespace cdi port-forward deployment/cdi-uploadproxy 8443` and provide `https://localhost:8443` as the CDI upload proxy URL. However, this approach will be less efficient. |                                   |

12. The import may take a few minutes to complete. The Palette CLI outputs the path for your OVA configuration file.
    Make a note of it.

13. Your imported OVA is now ready to be deployed to a new VM inside your VMO cluster. Execute the following command to
    start an interactive shell and begin the deployment process. Replace the path placeholder with the path of your OVA
    configuration file.

    ```shell
    palette vmo deploy-ova --config-file <path-to-ova-configuration-file>
    ```

    The Palette CLI prompts you for information regarding the VM you want to deploy.

    | **Parameter**               | **Description**                                   | **Values** |
    | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
    | **VM Namespace**            | The namespace to create your VM into.             |            |
    | **VM Name**                 | The namespace of your VM.                         |            |
    | **Start VM Automatically?** | Indicate whether to start your VM after creation. | `y`/ `N`   |

14. Depending on the configuration of your OVA, you may be prompted to provide additional values for the OVF template
    variables. The deployment of your VM should complete within a few minutes.

:::info

The import may generate a variety of warnings during the deployment process, including many repeated lines
containing the word `(BADINDEX)`. All of these warnings and messages can safely be ignored. If a fatal error is
encountered, Palette CLI will exit completely.

You may need to make minor edits to the auto-generated VM specification if you want to configure
<VersionedLink text="Multus" url="/integrations/packs/?pack=cni-multus" /> VLAN for each network interface.
If uploading your image to a `DataVolume` upload fails, you may restart the upload after debugging any CDI issues. Execute the command `palette vmo import-ova --config-file <path-to-ova-config.yaml> --skip-convert`.
