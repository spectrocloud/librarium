During large scale Kubernetes adoptions, workloads are often rehosted or migrated instead of being redeployed from
scratch. This process allows system administrators to copy the application, together with its data, to a Kubernetes
cluster. However, the migration of VMs can be time consuming if done manually, so it is often automated with open-source
tools such as [Forklift](https://github.com/kubev2v/forklift).

The [Palette CLI](../../../automation/palette-cli/palette-cli.md) provides the ability to migrate Virtual Machines (VMs)
from VMware vSphere to Palette VMO.

## Limitations

- You can only migrate VMs hosted in VMware vSphere.
- Only VMs whose operating systems are included under
  [`virt-v2v` supported guest systems](https://libguestfs.org/virt-v2v-support.1.html) can be migrated.

## Prerequisites

- A Healthy VMO cluster. Refer to the [Create a VMO Profile](../../create-vmo-profile.md) for further guidance.
- A VMware vSphere user account with the necessary permissions to manage the VMs you want to migrate.
  - Migration can optionally accelerated by providing credentials for the ESXi hosts where the VMs reside.
- One or more VMs hosted in VMware vSphere. Only VMs whose operating systems are included under
  [`virt-v2v` supported guest systems](https://libguestfs.org/virt-v2v-support.1.html) can be migrated.
  - The VMs must be powered off before migration.
  - Ensure that VMs operating Windows are shut down at the virtualized OS level.
  - If you are migrating more than one VM in the same plan, they must all share the same network.
- The Palette CLI installed and setup. Refer to the
  [Installation](../../../automation/palette-cli/install-palette-cli.md) guide for further details.
- The kubectl command-line tool should also be installed. Refer to the
  [kubectl installation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) guide to learn more.

:::warning

The VMO cluster must have access to VMware and the VM you want to migrate. The Palette CLI must have access to both the
VMO cluster and the machines to be migrated.

:::

## Migrate VMware vSphere VMs

1. Download the [Kubeconfig](../../../clusters/cluster-management/kubeconfig.md) file of the VMO cluster to the host
   where the Palette CLI is installed.

2. Open a terminal window and set the environment variable `KUBECONFIG` to point to the file you downloaded.

   ```shell
   export KUBECONFIG=<path-to-downloaded-kubeconfig-file>
   ```

3. Optionally, create a namespace where your VM will be migrated. We recommend that you migrate a VM to a dedicated
   namespace.

   ```shell
   kubectl create namespaces <migration-namespace>
   ```

4. Execute the following command to start an interactive shell and begin the migration process to the cluster specified
   by the `KUBECONFIG` variable.

   ```shell
   palette vmo migrate-vm
   ```

   :::tip

   You can save your configuration to a file, allowing you to revise your configuration and perform the migration later.

   ```shell
   palette vmo migrate-vm --config-only
   ```

   :::

   The Palette CLI prompts you for information regarding the VM you want to migrate, vSphere environment, and resource
   configurations.

5. The migration begins as soon as you complete the configuration. Execute the following command to watch the migration
   status. Replace the `<migration-name>` placeholder with the migration name you have configured.

   ```shell
   watch --interval 2 'kubectl --namespace konveyor-forklift get migrations.forklift.konveyor.io <migration-name>-migration'
   ```

   The migration with take approximately 20 minutes, depending on the size of the VM to migrate. Once the migration is
   complete, the `watch` command will output the following.

   ```shell
   Every 2.0s: kubectl --namespace konveyor-forklift get migrations.forklift.konveyor.io vmo-migration

   NAME           READY   RUNNING   SUCCEEDED   FAILED   AGE
   vmo-migration   True              True                 18m
   ```

## Validate

1. Log into [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com).

2. From the left **Main Menu**, select **Clusters**. Then, choose the VMO cluster that you migrated your VM to. The
   **Overview** tab appears.

3. Select the **Virtual Machines** tab. Then, select your migration namespace from the **Namespace** drop-down Menu.
   Your migrated VM appears.

4. Click on the **three-dot Menu** and select **Start**. Your VM is now ready to use.
