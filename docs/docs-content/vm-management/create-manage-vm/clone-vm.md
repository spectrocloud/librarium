A VM clone is a copy of an existing virtual machine (VM). The cloned VM has the same configuration settings and
identifiers as the parent VM. After you clone a VM, the cloned VM acts as a separate virtual machine.

Cloning is a quick way to create a new virtual machine that shares the same properties as the parent. You may want to
clone a VM for the following reasons:

- Software testing. Developers can clone an active VM to test new changes to their code.

- Forensics. Security administrators can clone an infected machine and connect it to an air-gaped network to investigate
  the source of the infection while the parent VM can be destroyed or remediated.

## Prerequisites

- An active cluster in Palette with the Virtual Machine Orchestrator (VMO) pack.

- Outbound internet connectivity for port 443 is allowed so that you and your applications can connect with the Spectro
  Cloud reverse proxy.

- Users or groups must be mapped to a Virtual Machine RBAC role. You can create a custom role through a manifest and use
  Palette's RoleBinding feature to associate users and groups with the role. Refer to the
  [Create Role Bindings](../../clusters/cluster-management/cluster-rbac.md#create-role-bindings) guide to learn more.

- A namespace for VMs. Although you can deploy VMs from the default namespace, we recommend creating at least one
  namespace dedicated to VMs as a way to organize and manage them. To learn how to create a namespace, check out
  [Create a Namespace](../../clusters/cluster-management/namespace-management.md#create-a-namespace).

## Clone a VM

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com).

2. From the left **Main Menu**, click **Clusters** and click on your cluster.

3. Click on the **Virtual Machine** tab.

4. Select the VM to clone and click either the **three-dot Menu** or **Actions**.

5. Power off the parent VM and click **Clone**. If you forget to power it off, the parent VM will automatically be
   powered off while cloning is in progress.

6. Give the clone a name, an optional description, and select a namespace.

7. Optionally, you can enable the checkbox to start the cloned VM automatically when cloning is complete.

## Validate

From the **Virtual Machines** tab, verify the cloned VM is listed and displays **Running** status.
