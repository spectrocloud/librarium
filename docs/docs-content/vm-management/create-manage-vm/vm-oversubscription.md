Palette Virtual Machine Orchestrator (VMO) allows administrators to oversubscribe the physical resources on a host to
maximize the number of active workloads.

VM workloads typically have varying resource demands and peak utilization patterns. By oversubscribing resources, it is
possible to allocate them flexibly and take advantage of the fact that not all VMs will require their maximum allocation
simultaneously.

The hypervisor automatically overcommits CPU and memory. This means that more virtualized CPU and memory can be
allocated to VMs than there are physical resources on the system.

<br />

## CPU Overcommit

Kubevirt offers the `cpuAllocationRatio` in its Custom Resource Definitions (CRD). This ratio is used to normalize the
amount of CPU time the pod will request based on the number of virtual CPUs (vCPUs).

Using the following algorithm, when `cpuAllocationRatio` is set to 1, the full amount of vCPUs are requested for the
pod: `pod CPU request = number of vCPUs * 1/cpuAllocationRatio`.

The `cpuAllocationRatio` is global, so setting it to greater than 1 has the effect of requesting less CPU from
Kubernetes for each VM.

Certain workloads that require a predictable latency and enhanced performance would benefit from obtaining dedicated CPU
resources. KubeVirt relies on the Kubernetes CPU manager to pin vCPUs to the physical hostâ€™s CPUs. To learn more, refer
to [Dedicated CPU Resources](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/virtual_machines/dedicated_cpu_resources/) and
[Resources Requests and Limits](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/virtual_machines/virtual_hardware/#resources-requests-and-limits)
Kubevirt documentation.

:::warning

- We do not recommend overcommitting CPUs in a production environment without extensive testing. Applications that use
  100 percent of processing resources may become unstable in overcommitted environments.

- Ensure you don't overcommit guest VMs on more than the physical number of processing cores. For example, a guest VM
  with four vCPUs should only be deployed on a host physical machine with a quad-core processor instead of a dual-core
  processor.

  We recommend no more than 10 total allocated vCPUs per physical processor core.

## Memory Overcommit

KubeVirt allows you to assign more or less memory to a VM than a VM requests to Kubernetes. You may want to overcommit
VM memory if you have a cluster or a few nodes that are dedicated to running VMs. In this case, overcommitting memory
makes use of all the memory in the nodes regardless of reserved or requested memory from the system.

To learn about options for memory overcommitment, refer to
[Node Overcommit](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/operations/node_overcommit/) KubeVirt resource.

You can make several changes to reduce the memory footprint and overcommit the per-VMI memory overhead.

<br />

- Enable guest overhead overcommit by setting `spec.domain.resources.overcommitGuestOverhead` to true.

- Enable guest memory by setting `spec.domain.memory.guest` to a value higher than
  `spec.domain.resources.requests.memory`, as shown in the example.

```yaml
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualMachineInstance
metadata:
  name: testvmi-nocloud
spec:
  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
  domain:
    resources:
      overcommitGuestOverhead: true
      requests:
        memory: 1024M
    memory:
      guest: 2048M
```

<br />

- Enable implicit memory overcommit by setting `spec.configuration.developerConfiguration.memoryOvercommit` in the
  KubeVirt CRD to a percentage of the desired memory overcommit.
