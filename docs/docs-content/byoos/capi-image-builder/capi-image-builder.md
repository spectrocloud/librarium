The CAPI Image Builder is a tool we developed and maintain to reduce the challenges associated with creating images for
Kubernetes clusters. It is based on the upstream
[Kubernetes Image Builder (KIB)](https://image-builder.sigs.k8s.io/introduction.html) project.

The tool includes all the dependencies required to build FIPS and non-FIPS images within a Docker container, eliminating
the need to install any dependencies on your local machine.
