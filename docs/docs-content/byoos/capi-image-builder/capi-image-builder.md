:::

The CAPI Image Builder is a tool we develop and maintain to reduce the challenges of creating images for Kubernetes
clusters. The tool is based on the upstream
[Kubernetes Image Builder](https://image-builder.sigs.k8s.io/introduction.html) (KIB) project. All the dependencies
required to build the images are included in the tool through a Docker image, removing the need to install any
dependencies on your local machine. The latter is especially useful when working within air-gapped environments.
