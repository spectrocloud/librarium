This guide provides instructions on how to use the CAPI Image Builder project to create images for Palette and VerteX.
You can use the CAPI Image Builder to create images for Kubernetes clusters deployed through Palette and VerteX that are
targeting Azure, AWS, GCP, and VMware vSphere. We encourage you to review the
[Configuration Reference](./config-reference.md) for more information on how to configure the CAPI Image Builder.

This guide will teach you how to create a standard image, or a FIPS-compliant image, for Palette and VerteX.
