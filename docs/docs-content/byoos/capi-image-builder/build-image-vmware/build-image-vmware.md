This section contains guides on how to use the CAPI Image Builder tool to create images for Palette and VerteX. The CAPI
Image Builder can be used in both airgapped and connected environments to build images for Kubernetes clusters deployed
through Palette and VerteX that target VMware vSphere. We encourage you to review the
[Configuration Reference](../config-reference.md) and [Compatibility Matrix](../comp-matrix-capi-builder.md) for more
information on how to configure the CAPI Image Builder.
