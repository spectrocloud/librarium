You can create a custom VMware vSphere RHEL image with
[Palette eXtended Kubernetes](../../../integrations/kubernetes.md) (PXK) and use it to deploy a Kubernetes cluster. You
can choose to build the custom RHEL image with PXK using FIPS or opt for a non-FIPS-compliant image. This workflow is
built on-top of the [Image Builder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder) project. Check out the
[Image Builder vSphere](https://image-builder.sigs.k8s.io/capi/providers/vsphere) section of the documentation to learn
more about this workflow.

Use the following steps to build a custom RHEL image with PXK for VMware vSphere and deploy a Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites met.

- Access to the VMware vSphere environment, including user credentials allowing you to create virtual machines.

- A valid [RHEL subscription](https://www.redhat.com/en/store/linux-platforms). You will need to provide the username
  and password for the subscription during the build process.

- An x86_64 Linux VM with the following resources:

  - 4 CPU
  - 8 GB of RAM
  - 100 GB of free disk space
  - Internet access
  - Git installed.
  - Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or later.

  <br />

  :::info

  You may choose to use a different Linux distribution, but the commands in this guide are specific to Ubuntu.

  :::

- The Linux VM must have connectivity to the internet and the VMware vSphere environment.

- Access to the [Red Hat Developer Portal](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/download?source=sso).

## Build Custom Image

Use the following steps to build a custom RHEL image with PXK for VMware vSphere. Select the tab based on whether you
want to create a FIPS-compliant image or a non-FIPS-compliant image.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="fips" label="FIPS">

1.  Open a terminal session and log in to the Linux VM.

2.  Download the x86_64 RHEL ISO from the
    [Red Hat Developer Portal](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/download?source=sso). Make sure you download
    the x86_64 DVD ISO and not the x86_64 BOOT ISO. This guide will use RHEL 8.8 as an example.

    :::tip

    Use the direct link to download the RHEL ISO locally through either `curl` or `wget`.

    :::

3.  Update the system and install the latest packages.

    ```bash
    sudo apt update --yes && sudo apt upgrade --yes
    ```

4.  Install HashiCorp Packer.

    ```bash
    wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
    echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install packer
    ```

5.  Install `ansible`, `make`, `jq`, `unzip`, and `python3`.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install --yes make unzip jq python3-pip git && \
    sudo apt install --yes software-properties-common
    sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
    sudo apt install --yes ansible
    ```

6.  Update the PATH environment variable to include Python. Make sure Python 3.10 or later is installed. Otherwise, you
    will encounter an error during the build process.

    ```bash
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin/python3 && \
    echo "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin/python3" >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

7.  Clone the forked Image Builder that contains customizations for PXK and switch to the `rhel-pxk-fips` branch.

    ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/spectrocloud/image-builder.git
     cd image-builder/images/capi
     git checkout rhel-pxk-fips
    ```

8.  Install the VMware and vSphere Packer plugins.

    ```bash
    packer plugins install github.com/hashicorp/vmware
    packer plugins install github.com/hashicorp/vsphere
    ```

9.  Prepare the image build by downloading dependencies needed by the image-builder scripts.

    ```bash
    make deps-ova
    ```

    :::tip

    If you encounter an error during the `make deps-ova` command, ensure you set the python3 path in the PATH
    environment variable correctly. Also, make sure Python 3.10 or later is installed

    :::

10. Update the **packer/ova/rhel-8.json** file and provide the path to the RHEL ISO image and the SHA256 checksum. Below
    is an example using RHEL 8.8. The ISO in this example is located at **/home/ubuntu/rhel-isos/**.

    ```json
    "iso_checksum": "517abcc67ee3b7212f57e180f5d30be3e8269e7a99e127a3399b7935c7e00a09",
    "iso_checksum_type": "sha256",
    "iso_url": "file:///home/ubuntu/rhel-isos/rhel-8.8-x86_64-dvd.iso",
    ```

    :::tip

    If you are unable to find the SHA256 checksum for the RHEL ISO, you can calculate it using the following command.
    Replace `/path/to/iso` with the path to the RHEL ISO you downloaded.

    ```bash
    sha256sum /path/to/iso
    ```

    :::

11. Update the **packer/ova/vsphere.json** file with all the required vSphere details. Use the table below to learn more
    about each required field.

    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <details>
    <summary>FIPS Components</summary>

    We maintain custom RPM repositories that are used to download FIPS compliant packages and images during the build.
    The following properties are already set to download FIPS RPM packages and images.

    ```json
    "kubernetes_container_registry": "gcr.io/spectro-images-fips",
    "kubernetes_rpm_gpg_key": "http://fips-rpms.spectrocloud.com/spectro_repo/gpg.key",
    "kubernetes_rpm_repo": "http://fips-rpms.spectrocloud.com/spectro_repo/",
    ```

    </details>

    In this guide, the Kubernetes version is set to `1.27.11`.

    ```json
    "kubernetes_rpm_version": "1.27.11",
    "kubernetes_semver": "v1.27.11",
    "kubernetes_series": "v1.27"
    ```

    :::warning

    The Kubernetes version you specify must be available in Palette. You must also select the version specified when
    creating a cluster profile that uses the custom image.

    :::

13. Build the RHEL image with PXK. Replace `RHSM_USER` and `RHSM_PASS` with your Red Hat subscription username and
    password. The build may take up to an hour to complete depending on your environment.

    ```bash
    PACKER_FLAGS=-on-error=ask RHSM_USER=xxxxxxx RHSM_PASS=xxxxxxxxxxxx make build-node-ova-vsphere-rhel-8
    ```

    :::tip

    You can set the RHEL credentials as environment variables to avoid providing them every time you issue the command.

    ```shell
    export RHSM_USER=xxxxxxx
    export RHSM_PASS=xxxxxxxxxxxx
    ```

    :::

    Upon completion, the following output is displayed. Make sure to note the name of the image.

    ```shell hideClipboard {7}
    ==> vsphere-iso.vsphere (shell-local): Running local shell script: /tmp/packer-shell3103701471

    --> vsphere-iso.vsphere: rhel-8-kube-v1.27.11
    --> vsphere-iso.vsphere: rhel-8-kube-v1.27.11
    ```

14. The custom RHEL image with PXK is now built and available in the VMware vSphere environment. You can use this image
    to deploy a Kubernetes cluster. To use the image, create a cluster profile with and select the
    [BYOOS pack](../../../integrations/byoos.md). Refer to the custom image in the cluster profile when populating the
    image details. You need to refer to the VM template path of the image.

    ```yaml hideClipboard
    pack:
      osImageOverride: "/Datacenter/vm/sp-docs/rhel-8-kube-v1.27.11"
      osName: "rhel"
      osVersion: "8.8"
    ```

    Using the following image, take note of the three numbers highlighted in the image name.

    1. The BYOOS pack is selected as the operating system layer.
    2. The custom RHEL image template is specified in the `osImageOverride` field.
    3. The Kubernetes version is set to `1.27.11`, the same version specified in the `kubernetes.json` file.

    ![A cluster profile using a custom RHEL image](/byoos_vmware_rhewl-pxk_cluster-profile.webp)

    Complete the remaining steps in the
    [cluster profile creation process](../../../profiles/cluster-profiles/create-cluster-profiles/create-infrastructure-profile.md).
    Use the cluster profile to deploy a Kubernetes cluster in your VMware vSphere environment with the custom RHEL
    image.

## Validate

1. Log in to the VMware vSphere environment and navigate to the Inventory view.

2. Select the **VMs and Templates** tab and verify the custom RHEL image with PXK is available.

:::info FIPS Verification

You can verify the FIPS mode is enabled on the custom RHEL image by SSH in to a cluster node and issuing the following
commands. Use the SSH key provided during the cluster creation process to log in to the node. The default user is
`spectro`.

```bash
cat /proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled
```

If the output is `1`, then FIPS mode is enabled. If the output is `0`, the FIPS mode is disabled.

```shell hideClipboard
