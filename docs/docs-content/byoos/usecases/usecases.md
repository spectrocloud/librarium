This section contains a collection of use cases for building and using custom OS images with Palette. Use these guides
to learn how to build custom OS images and use them to deploy Kubernetes clusters. If a specific use case is not covered
in this section, refer to the generic [Create Images with Image Builder](../image-builder.md) guide and use the
[Kubernetes Image Builder](https://image-builder.sigs.k8s.io/introduction.html) project to build your custom OS images.

Due to the number of possible use cases, only a few are covered in this section. If you have a specific use case that is
