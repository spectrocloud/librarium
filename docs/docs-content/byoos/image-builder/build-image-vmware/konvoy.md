This guide provides instructions for building a custom image using Red Hat Linux Enterprise (RHEL) with Konvoy. The
guide assumes that you have a basic understanding of VMware vSphere, RHEL and <VersionedLink text="Konvoy" url="/integrations/packs/?pack=kubernetes-konvoy" />.

You will use the [Konvoy image builder](https://github.com/mesosphere/konvoy-image-builder) project to build the custom
RHEL image with Konvoy. The custom image will be used to deploy a Kubernetes cluster on VMware vSphere.

## Prerequisites

Carefully review the prerequisites and follow the steps in the order provided to build and use a custom RHEL with
Konvoy. Make sure you have met all the prerequisites before you begin.

- A x86_64 Linux VM with the following resources:

  - 4 CPU
  - 8 GB of RAM
  - 50 GB of free disk space

- The Linux VM must have connectivity to the internet and the VMware vSphere environment.

- The following software must be installed on the Linux VM:

  - [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) version 25.0.0 or later.
  - [HashiCorp Packer](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/) version 1.10.1 or later.
  - [tar](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/) or similar tool to extract tarballs.
  - [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) or similar tool, such as curl to download files from the internet.

- A valid [RHEL subscription](https://www.redhat.com/en/store/linux-platforms). You will need to provide the username
  and password for the subscription during the build process.

- VMware vSphere template for RHEL 8.8 or later. The Konvoy image builder will use this template to create the custom
  RHEL with Konvoy image.

<summary>Click to learn more about VMware vSphere RHEL templates</summary>

You can download RHEL 8.8 or later ISO files from the
[Red Hat Developer Portal](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/download?source=sso). The ISO can be uploaded to
your vSphere Datastore and be used to deploy a VM. Deploy the VM and reference the ISO you uploaded to your Datastore as
the input for the **CD/DVD Drive**.

![A View of the ISO selection](/byoos_vmware_konvoy_iso-selection.webp)

After the VM is deployed, and you have completed the RHEL installation, verify you can SSH into the VM. If you can SSH
and log in to the VM, you can use it as a template for the Konvoy image builder. Save the VM as a template in vSphere.
Reference the template in the Konvoy image builder configuration file.

:::tip

Configure the RHEL VM with the correct users and credentials before creating a VM template of it. Consider adding the
following configuration to the `/etc/sudoers` file so that the root user and the `admin` and `sudo` groups can issue
commands as root without entering a password.

```shell
root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL
%sudo ALL=(ALL) ALL
Defaults        !authenticate
#Defaults   !visiblepw
```

:::

</details>

- SSH credentials to the RHEL template you are specifying in the Konvoy image builder configuration file.

  :::warning

  Reach out to your VMware administrator if you need assistance with creating the VMware vSphere template. It's critical
  you configure the RHEL template correctly to ensure the Konvoy image builder can the template to create the custom
  RHEL with Konvoy image.

## Build Image

The Konvoy image builder supports generating standard or FIPS-compliant Konvoy images. Select the appropriate tab for
instructions on how to build the custom RHEL with Konvoy image.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Standard" value="non'fips">

1.  Open a terminal session in your Linux VM and create a new directory for the Konvoy image builder project.

    ```shell
    mkdir --parents ~/builder
    cd ~/builder
    ```

2.  Download the Konvoy builder release artifact from the GitHub releases page. In this guide, version 2.8.5 is used.

    ```shell
    wget https://github.com/mesosphere/konvoy-image-builder/releases/download/v2.8.5/konvoy-image-bundle-v2.8.5_linux_amd64.tar.gz
    ```

3.  Extract the downloaded tarball and navigate to the builder directory.

    ```shell
    tar --extract --file  konvoy-image-bundle-v2.8.5_linux_amd64.tar.gz --directory builder && \
    cd builder
    ```

4.  Export your vSphere and RHEL credentials as environment variables. Replace the placeholders with your credentials.
    Issue the following commands to set these values in your terminal session.

    ```shell
    export VSPHERE_SERVER=your-vsphere-server-IP
    export VSPHERE_USERNAME=your-vsphere-username
    export VSPHERE_PASSWORD=your-vsphere-password
    export RHSM_USER=your-redhat-email
    export RHSM_PASS=your-redhat-password
    export ANSIBLE_SUDO_PASS=admin
    ```

5.  Modify the Packer configuration file for the version of RHEL you want to use. The RHEL configuration files are
    located in the **images/rhel** directory. In this guide, RHEL 8.8 is used. Use the following command to modify the
    file. You can use `vi` or any other text editor to modify the file.

    ```shell
    vi images/ova/rhel-88.yaml
    ```

6.  Replace the following placeholders in the RHEL configuration file with your vSphere and RHEL template information.

    | Parameter                    | Description                                                                                                                        |

## Validate

1. Log in to the vSphere web client and navigate to the datastore folder where the custom RHEL with Konvoy image is
   located. Verify that the image is present in the folder.

2. Create a cluster profile and use the BYOOS pack to reference the custom RHEL with Konvoy image. Specify the path to
   the custom RHEL with Konvoy image in the pack's YAML file. Refer to
   [Usage with Cluster Profile](#usage-with-cluster-profile) section for more details.

3. Deploy a cluster using the cluster profile you created.

## Usage with Cluster Profile

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
To use the custom RHEL with Konvoy image, create a
[cluster profile](../../../profiles/cluster-profiles/create-cluster-profiles/create-full-profile.md) and use the <VersionedLink text="BYOOS" url="/integrations/packs/?pack=generic-byoi"/> pack to reference the custom RHEL with
Konvoy image. Specify the vSphere path to the custom RHEL with Konvoy image in the pack's YAML file. The following
example YAML content demonstrates how to use the custom RHEL with Konvoy image in a cluster profile.
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

    ```yaml hideClipboard {2}
    pack:
      osImageOverride: "/Datacenter/vm/internal/rhel/konvoy-rhel-88-1.27.6-20240229212552"
      osName: "konvoy-rhel-vmware"
      osVersion: "8.8"
    ```

When selecting the Kubernetes distribution and version, pick Konvoy as the Kubernetes distribution and the version of
Kubernetes you specified in the Packer configuration file.

:::warning

Make sure you select the same version of Konvoy as specified in the Packer configuration file **images/common.yaml**.
