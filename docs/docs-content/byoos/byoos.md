Palette allows the flexibility to bring your own Operating System (OS) to use with your Kubernetes clusters. Use the
**Bring Your Own OS (BYOOS)** pack to upload your own OS images, configure drivers, and customize the OS to meet your
specific requirements. This feature is especially useful for organizations with strict requirements around security,
compliance, or specific hardware configurations.

The ability to bring your own OS to Palette gives you more control over dependencies in your environment and ensures
compatibility with your existing applications. The OS you bring can be commercial or an open-source distribution.

## Get Started

To get started with BYOOS, you need to create an OS image and make it available to Palette or VerteX. Review the
[Create Images with Image Builder](../byoos/image-builder/image-builder.md) guide to learn how to create an OS image
using the Kubernetes Image Builder (KIB) project.

## CAPI Image Builder

:::

An alternative to the default image building process that uses the Kubernetes Image Builder (KIB) project is the CAPI
Image Builder. The CAPI Image Builder is a tool we develop and maintain to reduce the challenges of creating images for
Kubernetes clusters. Check out the [Create Images with CAPI Image Builder](./capi-image-builder/capi-image-builder.md)
guide to learn how to use the [CAPI Image Builder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder) project to create
images for Palette and VerteX.
