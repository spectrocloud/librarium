[Packs](../../registries-and-packs/registries-and-packs.md) are a collection of reusable files and configurations
deployed to a cluster to provide core infrastructure functionality or customization through add-on integrations. They
are the building blocks of [cluster profiles](../../profiles/profiles.md), enabling you to standardize, scale, and
manage Kubernetes environments across different teams and lifecycle stages.

Explore the tutorial below to learn how to create and deploy a custom pack.
