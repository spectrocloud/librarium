Edge clusters are Kubernetes clusters configured on Edge hosts. These hosts can be either bare metal or virtual machines
and must have the Palette agent installed.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to install the Palette agent on your virtual or physical host. You will boot the
host using the Edge installer ISO created in the [Build Edge Artifacts](./build-edge-artifacts.md) tutorial, and then
register the host with Palette. Once registered, the host will be ready to be part of an Edge cluster.

## Prerequisites

- A bare metal or virtual Linux host with an AMD64 processor architecture (also known as `x86_64`) and the following
  minimum hardware specifications.
  - 2 CPUs
  - 8 GB memory
  - 150 GB storage
- If you plan to use a virtual machine as the Edge host, ensure that you have a VMM (Virtual Machine Manager) installed.
  This tutorial uses
  [VirtualBox](https://www.oracle.com/virtualization/technologies/vm/downloads/virtualbox-downloads.html) version 7.0 as
  an example. Additionally, the underlying physical host must allow the creation of a VM that meets the same minimum
  hardware requirements.
- The Edge installer ISO file built in the [Build Edge Artifacts](./build-edge-artifacts.md) tutorial. If you are using
  a physical device as the Edge host, ensure the device has USB ports, the ISO file is flashed to a USB drive, and you
  are able to modify the host's boot order settings to boot from the USB drive.
- A DHCP-enabled network with at least one available IP address for the Edge host.
- A [Palette account](https://www.spectrocloud.com/get-started).
- The host must have access to the internet.

## Set Up Edge Host

<Tabs groupId="host">

<TabItem label="VM Host" value="VM Host">

Once the Edge artifacts and cluster profile have been created, you can proceed with the VirtualBox VM deployment. The VM
will use the Edge installer ISO to bootstrap the Edge installation and serve as the Edge host for your cluster.

Launch the VirtualBox application and click **New** to create a new VM.

Give the machine a name, for example, `edge-vm`.

In the **ISO Image** field, select the Edge installer ISO file you built in the
[Build Edge Artifacts](./build-edge-artifacts.md) tutorial. The ISO file is located in the `CanvOS/build` directory.

Set the machine **Type** as `Linux` and the **Version** as `Ubuntu (64-bit)`, and click **Next**.

Adjust the **Base Memory** to `8000 MB` and **Processors** to `2 CPU`. Click **Next** to proceed.

Set the **Disk Size** to 150 GB and ensure the option **Pre-Allocate Full Size** is _not_ checked. Click **Next**.

:::info

These are the minimum hardware requirements for an Edge host. In production environments, the required configuration may
vary.

:::

Confirm the VM settings and click **Finish** to create the VM.

Select the VM to adjust its network settings. Click **Settings**, then select **Network**.

Change the **Attached to:** option from `NAT` to `Bridged Adapter`. This allows the VM to receive an IP address from the
same network as the host. Click **OK**.

Select the created VM and click **Start** to turn it on. The Edge installer bootstraps the Palette Edge installation
onto the VM.

Wait for the Edge Installer to complete copying content to the VM. This process may take a few minutes. The VM shuts
down when the installation is complete.

After the VM powers off, select it in VirtualBox. Click **Settings**, then select **Storage**.

Select the Edge installer ISO and click **Remove Attachment** to remove it from your VM. Confirm the deletion with
**Remove** and click **OK** to close the settings window.

Once the Edge artifacts and cluster profile have been created, you can proceed with the Palette agent installation. The
bare metal device will use the Edge installer ISO to bootstrap the Edge installation and serve as the Edge host for your
cluster.

Insert the USB drive containing the flashed Edge installer ISO into the powered-off bare metal device.

Power on the device and enter the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) interface. You can accomplish this by pressing
**F2**, **F1**, or **F10** immediately after powering on the device. The exact key varies by manufacturer. Consult the
manufacturer instructions to learn how to enter the BIOS interface.

In the BIOS interface, navigate to the boot sequence section and locate the boot sequence list.

Find the entry with your USB drive and move it to the top of the list. Save the changes and exit the BIOS interface. The
device then boots from the USB drive and begins installing the Palette agent.

Wait for the Edge installer to complete copying content to the device. Once the installation is complete, the device
automatically powers off.

Once the device powers off, remove the USB drive. The device is now ready to be registered with Palette as an Edge host.

## Register Edge Host

<Tabs groupId="host">

<TabItem label="VM Host" value="VM Host">

To register the host with Palette, select the VM in VirtualBox and click **Start** to power it on. The VM boots and
obtains an IP address from the host machine's bridged network.

After a few minutes, the VM screen displays an IP address and automatically registers with Palette as an Edge host,
using the registration token provided in the `user-data` file during the [Prepare User Data](./prepare-user-data.md)
tutorial.

:::tip

You can provide site-specific Edge installer configuration user data if you need to apply new values or override default
values from the Edge installer user data you created during the EdgeForge process. Refer to
[Apply Site User Data](../../../clusters/edge/site-deployment/site-installation/site-user-data.md) for more information.

:::

Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com/). From the left main menu, select **Clusters**. Click the **Edge
Hosts** tab to view the registered hosts.

Confirm that your Edge host is listed with a **Healthy** and **Ready** status. The **Machine ID** displayed in Palette
should match the ID displayed on the VM screen.

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Bare Metal Host" value="Bare Metal Host">

To register the host with Palette, power on your bare metal device. Let Palette Edge choose the registration boot option
automatically from the GRand Unified Bootloader (GRUB) menu. The device boots and obtains an IP address from the
network.

After a few minutes, the device screen displays an IP address and automatically registers with Palette as an Edge host,
using the registration token provided in the `user-data` file during the [Prepare User Data](./prepare-user-data.md)
tutorial.

## Next Steps

In this tutorial, you learned how to install the Palette agent on your host and register the host with Palette. We
recommend proceeding to the [Deploy Edge Cluster] tutorial to learn how to use the registered Edge host to deploy an
Edge cluster in Palette.
