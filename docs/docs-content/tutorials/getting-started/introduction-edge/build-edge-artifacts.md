One of the first steps in deploying an Edge cluster is preparing your Edge host with all the required artifacts. The
process of building these artifacts is called
[EdgeForge](../../../clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/edgeforge-workflow.md), and it is responsible for generating the
installer ISO and provider image artifacts.

- Installer ISO: An ISO image that installs the Palette Edge agent on the host.
- Provider Images: [Kairos-based](https://kairos.io/) images that include the Operating System (OS) and the desired
  Kubernetes versions. These images install an immutable OS and the software dependencies compatible with the selected
  Kubernetes version during cluster deployment.

This tutorial teaches you how to build the artifacts required for your Edge deployment. Once built, you will be ready to
learn how to reference them in Edge [cluster profiles](../../../profiles/profiles.md) and how they are used to install
the Palette agent on hosts.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, ensure the following prerequisites are in place.

- You have completed the steps in the [Prepare User Data for Edge Installation](./prepare-user-data.md) tutorial,
  including cloning the CanvOS repository and creating and validating a user data file.
- A physical or virtual Linux machine with an AMD64 (also known as `x86_64`) processor architecture and the following
  minimum hardware configuration:
  - 4 CPUs
  - 8 GB memory
  - 150 GB storage
- The following software installed:
  - [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) with
    [`sudo`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) privileges. Alternatively, you can install
    [Earthly](https://earthly.dev/), in which case you do not need `sudo` privileges.
  - [jq](https://jqlang.org/download/), if you build the artifacts using the [script](#automate-edgeforge).
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Define Arguments

Open a terminal window on your Linux machine and navigate to the `CanvOS` repository that you cloned in the
[Prepare User Data for Edge Installation](./prepare-user-data.md) tutorial. This repository contains the utilities
required to build the artifacts.

```shell
cd CanvOS
```

Check the available Git tags.

```shell
git tag
```

Check out the desired tag. We recommend using a CanvOS major version that is the same as, or older than, Palette's major
version. This tutorial uses the tag `v4.6.9` as an example.

```
git checkout v4.6.9
```

EdgeForge leverages [Earthly](https://earthly.dev/) to build the installer ISO and provider images artifacts. A `.arg`
file is used to pass the values of a few arguments, such as the provider image tag and registry name, to Earthly for the
build process.

:::info

While both the `.arg` file and [user-data](./prepare-user-data.md) file are configuration files used during the
EdgeForge process, they serve different purposes. The `.arg` file is used to customize the Edge artifact build process.
For example, you can specify the name of the installer ISO to be built, the Kubernetes distribution and version for the
provider images, the registry to push the images to, and more. The
[Edge Artifact Build Configurations](../../../clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/palette-canvos/arg.md) page contains a
list of all the configurable parameters. In contrast, the `user-data` file focuses on customizing the installer ISO.
When the Edge host boots from the installer ISO, it applies the user data configuration to the host.

:::

Set a custom tag for the provider images. The tag must be an alphanumeric lowercase string. This tutorial uses
`gs-tutorial` as an example.

```bash
export CUSTOM_TAG=gs-tutorial
```

Next, issue the following command to create the `.arg` file using the custom tag. The remaining arguments will use
predefined values. For example, this tutorial uses [K3s](https://k3s.io/) version `1.32.1` as the Kubernetes
distribution, Ubuntu as the OS distribution, and [ttl.sh](https://ttl.sh/) as the image registry. Review the
`k8s_version.json` file in the CanvOS repository for all supported Kubernetes versions.

:::warning

If you are using a CanvOS tag that is earlier than v4.4.12, the `k8s_version.json` file does not exist in those tags. In
that case, review the `Earthfile` file in the CanvOS repository for all supported Kubernetes versions.

:::

```bash
cat << EOF > .arg
CUSTOM_TAG=$CUSTOM_TAG
IMAGE_REGISTRY=ttl.sh
OS_DISTRIBUTION=ubuntu
IMAGE_REPO=ubuntu
OS_VERSION=22.04
K8S_DISTRIBUTION=k3s
K8S_VERSION=1.32.1
ISO_NAME=palette-edge-installer
ARCH=amd64
UPDATE_KERNEL=false
EOF
```

Verify that the file was created correctly using the `cat` command.

```
cat .arg
```

:::tip

You can also use the [Appliance Studio](../../../deployment-modes/appliance-mode/appliance-studio.md) configuration
Graphic User Interface (GUI) to help you create the `.arg` file.

:::

## Build Artifacts

Issue the following command to build the Edge artifacts.

```bash
sudo ./earthly.sh +build-all-images
```

The build may take 15 to 20 minutes to complete, depending on the hardware resources available on the host machine. Once
complete, a success message appears.

```text hideClipboard title="Example Success Message"
========================== üåç Earthly Build  ‚úÖ SUCCESS ==========================
```

The output also includes a manifest with predefined values required to create the Edge cluster profile. These parameters
reference the built provider image. Copy and save the manifest, as you will need it for the next tutorial.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
pack:
  content:
    images:
      - image: "{{.spectro.pack.edge-native-byoi.options.system.uri}}"
  # Below config is default value, please uncomment if you want to modify default values
  #drain:

  system.k8sDistribution: k3s
  system.osName: ubuntu
  system.peVersion: v4.6.9
  system.customTag: gs-tutorial
  system.osVersion: 22.04
```

Confirm that the Edge installer ISO and its checksum have been created correctly.

```bash
ls build
```

```text hideClipboard
palette-edge-installer.iso
palette-edge-installer.iso.sha256
```

List the container images to confirm that the provider images were built successfully.

```bash
docker images --filter=reference="*/*:*$CUSTOM_TAG"
```

```text hideClipboard
REPOSITORY      TAG                                IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
ttl.sh/ubuntu   k3s-1.32.1-v4.6.9-gs-tutorial      75811e3dfb42   13 minutes ago   4.93GB
```

## Push Provider Images

Push the provider image to the [ttl.sh](https://ttl.sh/) registry so that your Edge host can download it during the
cluster deployment.

```bash
docker push ttl.sh/ubuntu:k3s-1.32.1-v4.6.9-$CUSTOM_TAG
```

The output confirms that the image was pushed to the registry with the correct tag and is ready to be used in a cluster
profile.

```text hideClipboard
...
k3s-1.32.1-v4.6.9-gs-tutorial: digest: sha256:c0045ff16f01c3fac47fdff83a051ab0c2fee1ff600b8b8e35caa6aa86736478 size: 16783
```

:::warning

[ttl.sh](https://ttl.sh/) is a free registry and does not require you to sign in. However, this is a short-lived image
registry, which means that the pushed images will expire after 24 hours. Refer to the
[Build Edge Artifacts](../../../clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/palette-canvos/palette-canvos.md) guide to learn how to
push images to a different registry.

## Automate EdgeForge

The following example script automates the EdgeForge process. It provides an alternative way to build the artifacts if
you have already learned the steps and want to replicate them quickly. You can skip this section if you have followed
the tutorial and built the artifacts manually.

The script clones the CanvOS repository, creates a sample `user-data` file, or uses the one provided by the user. It
then builds the Edge artifacts and pushes the provider images to the registry. The script prompts the user for a few
options, including the CanvOS Git tag, Kubernetes distribution and version for the provider images, and more.

Follow the steps below to build the artifacts using the script.

   ```

4. Once the build is complete, the script generates a manifest in `CanvOS/manifest-profile.yaml` with predefined values
   required to create the cluster profile. Ensure to save this manifest, as you will need it for the next tutorial.

5. Confirm that the Edge installer ISO and its checksum have been created correctly.

   ```bash
   ls build
   ```

   ```text hideClipboard
   palette-edge-installer.iso
   palette-edge-installer.iso.sha256
   ```

## Next Steps

In this tutorial, you built the artifacts required for your Edge deployment. We recommend proceeding to the
[Create Edge Cluster Profile](./edge-cluster-profile.md) tutorial, where you will learn how to create an Edge native
cluster profile that references the built provider image. You will then learn how to use the installer ISO to bootstrap
the Edge installation on your host and use it as a node for deploying your first Edge cluster.
