This section gives you an overview of how to get started with Palette. You will begin by learning the core
concepts of Palette, then move on to creating cluster profiles, which are the blueprints for your Kubernetes stacks.
Next, you will deploy your first cluster using the created cluster profile. After deployment, you will explore how to
update the cluster using Palette's cluster management functionality. The Getting Started section also covers other
topics you can explore further, such as cluster deployment with Terraform and Palette's additional capabilities.
