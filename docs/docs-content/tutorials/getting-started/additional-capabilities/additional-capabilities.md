Palette offers a range of additional capabilities designed to enable its users to deploy, scale, and effectively manage
Kubernetes workloads across a wide variety of environments and deployment options.

This section introduces you to some of Palette's additional capabilities, which include:

- Managing thousands of clusters in remote locations with [Edge](./edge.md).
- Supporting high-security requirements with our FIPS-validated [VerteX](./self-hosted.md#palette-vertex) edition.
- Self-hosting the Palette management plane in your own environment with
  [Self-Hosted Palette](./self-hosted.md#self-hosted-palette).
- Integrating virtual machine workloads into Kubernetes environments with [Virtual Machine Orchestrator](./vmo.md).

The concepts you learn about in the Getting Started section are centered around a fictional case study company,
Spacetastic Ltd.

## 🧑‍🚀 Back at Spacetastic HQ

Spacetastic has been a Palette customer for a few months. In this time, they have become the leading astronomy education
platform. They want to keep pushing the limits of their platform and implement some innovative capabilities. To support
this growth, they will need to expand their team, infrastructure, and systems. They continue exploring the Getting
Started section to learn how they can grow with Palette and have a long-term relationship with Spectro Cloud.

> "Wouldn’t bringing some astronomy into everyone's home be great?" says Anya, Lead Astrophycist, who has always the
> dreamer of the team. "I wonder how we could make that possible."
>
> Kai is in charge of scaling the Spacetastic platform. "That would be a great dream and a challenge for us, Anya." they
> say.
>
> "You know, we might be able to make your dream happen!" says Wren, Founding Engineer. "Palette's edge capabilities
> could make it possible for us to bring Spacetastic to many devices."
>
> "I can't believe my ears!" says Kai laughing. "Wren, our resident Palette skeptic, has well and truly embraced our new
> platform solution."
>
> Wren laughs and quickly responds. "Oh and one more thing! Palette doesn't lock us into a single tech stack or cloud
> provider, so we can deploy our services in many locations."
>
> "Palette makes Kubernetes just as secure on edge devices as it is in large data centers." says Meera, Head of
> Cybersecurity, joining in. "We'll make your dream a reality and bring Spacetastic to everyone soon enough, Anya. The
> sky's the limit for us!"
