Palette Private Cloud Gateway (PCG) is a crucial infrastructure support component that acts as a bridge between your
private cloud environment or data center and Palette.

A PCG is required in environments lacking direct network access to Palette. For example, many infrastructure
environments reside within private networks that restrict external connections, preventing internal devices and
resources from reaching Palette directly.

Upon installation, the PCG initiates a connection from inside the private network to Palette, serving as an endpoint for
Palette to communicate with the infrastructure environment. The PCG continuously polls Palette for instructions to
either deploy or delete Kubernetes clusters within the environment. This connection uses a secure communication channel
that is encrypted using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. Once a cluster is deployed, the PCG is no longer
involved in the communication between Palette and the deployed cluster. The cluster then communicates directly with
Palette through the Palette agent available within each cluster, which originates all network requests outbound toward
Palette. Refer to the [PCG Architecture](../../../clusters/pcg/architecture.md) section for more information.

A PCG comprises a cluster of nodes and can be deployed using two methods. The first method uses the Palette CLI to
deploy a PCG in one of the three supported infrastructure environments; MAAS, OpenStack, or VMware vSphere. The other
method manually deploys a PCG [onto an existing Kubernetes cluster](../../../clusters/pcg/deploy-pcg-k8s.md).

In this tutorial, you will deploy a VMware PCG using Palette CLI. Next, you will learn how to deploy a VMware cluster
with a sample Kubernetes application called
[Hello Universe](https://github.com/spectrocloud/hello-universe#hello-universe), utilizing either the Palette dashboard
or Terraform.

The following diagram illustrates the components that will be deployed in this tutorial and how they communicate with
each other.

  The <VersionedLink text="MetalLB" url="/integrations/packs/?pack=lb-metallb-helm"/> pack provides a load-balancer
  implementation for your Kubernetes cluster, as VMware does not offer a load balancer solution natively. The load
  balancer is required to help the _LoadBalancer_ service specified in the Hello Universe application manifest obtain an
  IP address, so that you can access the application on your browser.

- **cluster.tf** - Configuration for the `spectrocloud_cluster_vsphere` resource.

- **data.tf** - Configuration for the resources to retrieve data from Palette dynamically.

- **inputs.tf** - Variables used in the tutorial, such as the PCG name, SSH key, and vSphere endpoint.

- **outputs.tf** - Output variables that display information to the terminal once the resources are created. For
  example, upon cluster deployment, the location of the SSH key and the command to SSH into your cluster nodes are
  displayed in the terminal.

- **provider.tf** - Terraform providers configuration.

- **ssh-key.tf** - Resources to generate an SSH key pair in case the user does not provide one.

- **ippool.tf** - This file contains the resources required for static IP placement deployments. You will note that the
  resource `spectrocloud_privatecloudgateway_ippool` is currently commented out as this tutorial uses dynamic IP
  placement.

- **terraform.tfvars** - Variable definitions required for the cluster deployment.

Open the **terraform.tfvars** file in the editor of your choice and provide the values for the variables according to
the table below.

| Variable Name        | Description                                                                                                 | Required |

### Delete the PCG

<PartialsComponent category="pcg-vmware" name="delete-pcg-ui" />

## Wrap-Up

In this tutorial, you learned how to deploy a VMware PCG using the Palette CLI. Then, you used the PCG to support the
deployment of a Kubernetes cluster with a sample application to your VMware vSphere environment. Next, you accessed the
Hello Universe application landing page through the exposed service URL.

A PCG is a powerful component that enables Palette to communicate with private clouds or data center environments
residing in restricted networks that don't allow inbound connections from external sources. The PCG acts as an endpoint
and continuously polls Palette for instructions. With a PCG, you can deploy Palette clusters and support their lifecycle
in environments like VMware vSphere without the need to configure complex firewall rules or expose public endpoints.

We encourage you to check out the reference resources below to learn more about PCGs.
