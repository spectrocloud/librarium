[Cluster profile variables](../../../../profiles/cluster-profiles/create-cluster-profiles/define-profile-variables/)
allow you to provide profile-layer specific configurations. This capability provides you the ability to reuse a profile
version for many different deployments while using unique specifications.

In many ways, this treats the cluster profile as a template that can be used and reused for Day-2 operations. It is
important to consider the type of variable you create and use, and its context in the packs it is applied against. Some
variables can be applied while a cluster is running; others may only be relevant when the cluster is deployed; and some
may not be good candidates due to strict restrictions on the value. Refer to the
[Limitations](../../../../profiles/cluster-profiles/create-cluster-profiles/define-profile-variables/#limitations)
section for further information on cluster profile variable definition.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use cluster profile variables with workload clusters through both
[Palette's UI](#cluster-profile-variables-ui-workflow) and [Terraform](#cluster-profile-variables-terraform-workflow)
workflows. While the tutorial demonstrates the workflow using Amazon Web Services (AWS), you can also use the same steps
with Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Prerequisites

- A Palette account.
- A Palette API key if you choose to follow along using the [Terraform](#cluster-profile-variables-terraform-workflow)
  workflow. Refer to the [Create a Palette API Key ](../../../../getting-started/aws/setup/#create-a-palette-api-key)
  guide for further instructions.
- A public cloud account registered in Palette. Refer to
  [AWS](../../../../clusters/public-cloud/aws/add-aws-accounts/#aws-account),
  [Azure](../../../../clusters/public-cloud/azure/azure-cloud/#add-azure-cloud-account) or
  [Google Cloud](../../../../clusters/public-cloud/gcp/add-gcp-accounts/#create-account) to learn how to register a
  cloud account.
- An SSH key available in the region where you plan to deploy the cluster.
- Ensure that the
  [Palette Community Registry](../../../registries-and-packs/registries/registries.md#default-registries) is available
  in your Palette environment. Refer to the
  [Add OCI Packs Registry](../../../registries-and-packs/registries/oci-registry/add-oci-packs.md) guide for additional
  guidance.
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation)
  installed if you choose to follow along using the tutorial container.
- Basic knowledge of containers and Kubernetes manifest file attributes. Refer to the
  [Docker Get Started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) guide and the
  [Learn Kubernetes Basics](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/) tutorial to start learning.
- Kubectl installed locally. Use the Kubernetes [Install Tools](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) for additional
  guidance.

## Cluster Profile Variables (UI Workflow)

In this part of the tutorial, you will use [Palette's UI](https://console.spectrocloud.com/) to create your cluster and
cluster profile. The cluster profile will have two versions as part of it. The **1.0.0** version will be a clean,
default version without cluster profile variables, while the **1.1.0** version will have the variables added to it.

### Create Cluster Profile

Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com/), select **Profiles** from the left main menu, and click **Add
Cluster Profile**.

Assign the cluster profile a name and leave the default value for the version. Click **Next** to continue.

In the **Profile Layers** section, configure your profile with the following packs.

After adding the packs to your cluster profile, click **Confirm & Create**.

Click **Next**. Then, click **Finish Configuration** to create the **1.0.0** cluster profile version.

### Add Cluster Profile Variables

Cluster profile versioning provides better change visibility and control over the layers in your host clusters. Refer to
the [Version a Cluster Profile](../../../../profiles/cluster-profiles/modify-cluster-profiles/version-cluster-profile/)
guide to learn more about cluster profile versioning.

To create a new cluster profile version, click on **Profiles** in the left main menu and select your cluster profile.

From the drop-down menu next to the cluster profile name, select **Create new version**.

Provide the version number `1.1.0` and click **Confirm**. A versioning successful message displays. Select
**\{\}Variables**. Next, select **\{\} Create variable**.

On the **Create variable** page, fill in the following information.

| Variable Setting  | Value                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Variable**      | `wordpress_namespace`                    |
| **Display name**  | `WordPress: Namespace`                   |
| **Description**   | `Namespace for the WordPress pack`       |
| **Format**        | Select **String** from the drop-down.    |
| **Default value** | Enable the option and enter `wordpress`. |

Click **Create** to create the cluster profile variable.

![Image that shows how to create the variable](/tutorials/deploy-cluster-profile-variables/clusters_cluster-management_deploy-cluster-profile-variables-create-variable.webp)

You can now add the created cluster profile variable to the cluster profile. Click the **Copy to clipboard** icon and
close the **Profile variables** tab.

You must add the variable to the pack manifest YAML file in order to use it. Click on the WordPress pack, and select the
**Values** button to open the editor. Paste the variable to replace the default namespace value.

Click **Confirm Updates**, and then click **Save Changes**. This will make the variable part of the cluster profile.

![Image that shows adding variable and confirm update](/tutorials/deploy-cluster-profile-variables/clusters_cluster-management_deploy-cluster-profile-variables-add-variable-and-confirm-update.webp)

As shown in the following image, the namespace variable is displayed as in use in one layer, corresponding to the
WordPress pack.

![Image that shows variables in use and warning that profile version in use](/tutorials/deploy-cluster-profile-variables/clusters_cluster-management_deploy-cluster-profile-variables-variable-layer-inuse.webp)

Next, select **{} Create variable** to add the remaining variables. Add the following variables and their default values
to the new version of the cluster profile. After each variable, ensure you click **Create**.

#### Variable: wordpress_replica

| Variable Setting  | Value                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Variable**      | `wordpress_replica`                        |
| **Display name**  | `WordPress: Replica Count`                 |
| **Description**   | `Number of replicas for the WordPress app` |
| **Format**        | Select **Number** from the drop-down.      |
| **Default value** | Enable the option and enter `1`.           |

#### Variable: wordpress_port

| Variable Setting  | Value                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Variable**      | `wordpress_port`                     |
| **Display name**  | `WordPress: New HTTP WordPress port` |
| **Description**   | `New port for WordPress HTTP`        |
| **Format**        | Select **Number** from drop-down.    |
| **Default value** | Enable the option and enter `80`.    |

Now that your variables are created, add them to the WordPress manifest YAML using the same steps as you used for
`{{.spectro.var.wordpress_namespace}}`. For each variable, copy it to the clipboard and add it to the line location as
noted in the following table.

Paste `'{{.spectro.var.wordpress_replica}}'` to the value of the `charts.wordpress.replicaCount` resource.

![Image that shows WordPress variable for replicas](/tutorials/deploy-cluster-profile-variables/clusters_cluster-management_deploy-cluster-profile-variables-replicacount.webp)

Next, paste `'{{.spectro.var.wordpress_port}}'` to the value of the `charts.wordpress.service.ports.http` resource.

![Image that shows WordPress variable for ports](/tutorials/deploy-cluster-profile-variables/clusters_cluster-management_deploy-cluster-profile-variables-http-port.webp)

Click **Confirm Updates** and **Save Changes** to add the new variables to the WordPress pack.

### Deploy Cluster with Cluster Profile Variables

Your cluster profile now has two versions, one without variables and one with variables. You could either deploy two
separate clusters, one for each version, or deploy one cluster using version 1.0.0 and then upgrade it to version 1.1.0.
This tutorial demonstrates the latter option.

In [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com/), select your profile and ensure the drop-down menu is set to version
1.0.0 . Select **Deploy** to deploy the cluster. Check out the
[Deploy a Cluster](../../../../getting-started/aws/deploy-k8s-cluster/) tutorial for guidance on how to deploy a
cluster. The cluster deployment process can take 15 to 30 minutes. You can use either the Palette UI or the kubectl tool
to verify that the deployment was successful.

<Tabs groupId="cluster-deployment-verification">

<TabItem label="kubectl" value="Access Cluster with CLI">
From the left main menu, select **Clusters**. Then, select the cluster you created in this tutorial. Select the **Overview** tab, navigate to the middle column containing cluster details and locate the **Kubernetes Config File** row.

Click on the **Admin Kubeconfig File** link to download the file.

![Image that shows how to download kubeconfig file](/tutorials/deploy-cluster-profile-variables/clusters_cluster-management_deploy-cluster-profile-variables-download-kubeconfig.webp)

Open a terminal window and set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to the file path of the kubeconfig file.

```shell title="Example"
export KUBECONFIG=~/Downloads/admin.aws-profile-variables.kubeconfig
```

Use the following command to get a listing of the default pod deployment for the Wordpress app. Three pods are displayed
similar to the following output: one for MariaDB, one for WordPress database memory cache and one for the WordPress web
server. The row highlighted in the output is an example of the Wordpress web server.

```shell
kubectl get pods --namespace wordpress
```

```shell title="Example Output" {3}

<TabItem label="Palette UI" value="Palette UI Workloads">
Select your cluster once it is deployed and then navigate to the **Workloads** tab. Then, select **Pods** and filter for
**wordpress**. Three pods are displayed similar to the following screenshot: one for MariaDB, one for WordPress database
memory cache, and one for the WordPress web server. This is the default deployment behavior for the WordPress pack.

Return to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com/), select your profile and use the drop-down menu to set the
profile version to **1.1.0**. Choose **Review & Save**. On the **Changes Summary** page, select **Review changes in
Editor**.

Select **{} Profile variables changes**, open the **Review Update Changes**, and enter the following new values for each
variable.

| Variable Name                | New Value          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **WordPress: Replica Count** | `3`                |
| **WordPress: HTTP Port**     | `9090`             |
| **WordPress: Namespace**     | `new-wordpress-ns` |

![Image that shows how to copy and paste variable, then save it in the YAML file](/tutorials/deploy-cluster-profile-variables/clusters_cluster-management_deploy-cluster-profile-variables-update-variables.webp)

Click **Apply Changes**. Wait until the cluster completes the **Addon deployment** step. This process causes the cluster
to create a new namespace and three new replicas for WordPress under the new namespace, without deleting the existing
resources. It will also cause the WordPress application to open a new HTTP port.

Select the **Overview** tab to verify that the WordPress pack was deployed successfully. Click on the `:9090` port to
launch the default Wordpress application.

### Cleanup

Use the following steps to clean up the resources you created for the tutorial.

From the left main menu, select **Clusters**. Then, select the cluster you created in this tutorial.

Select **Settings** to expand the menu, and select **Delete Cluster**.

A dialog appears. Input the cluster name to confirm the delete action.

The deletion process takes several minutes to complete.

Once the cluster is deleted, select **Profiles** from the left main menu.

Select the cluster profile you created in this tutorial. Select the three-dot menu to display the **Delete** button.

Select **Delete** and confirm the selection to remove the cluster profile. Make sure you delete both versions of this
profile.

## Cluster Profile Variables (Terraform Workflow)

When you create cluster profiles in Terraform, the cluster profile variables can be defined in the profile versions that
you want to apply the variables against.

<PartialsComponent category="getting-started" name="setup-local-environment" />

Navigate to the folder that contains the tutorial code.

```shell
cd terraform/cluster-profile-variables-tf
```

### Resources Review

To help you get started with Terraform, the tutorial code is structured to support deploying a cluster to either AWS,
Azure, or GCP. Before you deploy a host cluster to AWS, review the following files in the folder structure.

| **File**                               | **Description**                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **provider.tf**                        | This file contains the Terraform providers that are used to support the deployment of the cluster.                     |
| **inputs.tf**                          | This file contains all the Terraform variables required for the deployment logic.                                      |
| **data.tf**                            | This file contains all the query resources that perform read actions.                                                  |
| **cluster_profiles.tf**                | This file contains the cluster profile definitions for each cloud provider.                                            |
| **clusters.tf**                        | This file has the cluster configurations required to deploy a host cluster to one of the cloud providers.              |
| **terraform.tfvars**                   | Use this file to target a specific cloud provider and customize the deployment. This is the only file you must modify. |
| **ssh-key.tf**                         | This file has the SSH key resource definition required for Azure deployments.                                          |
| **outputs.tf**                         | This file contains the content that will be displayed in the terminal after a successful Terraform `apply` action.     |
| **manifests/wordpress-default.yaml**   | This file contains the default configuration for the WordPress pack.                                                   |
| **manifests/wordpress-varaibles.yaml** | This file contains the configuration for the WordPress pack with cluster profile variables added.                      |

Open the **cluster_profiles.tf** file. In the **AWS Cluster Profile v1.0.0**, there are no variables defined and the
WordPress pack points to `wordpress-default.yaml`. This file is the default YAML configuration file for the WordPress
pack. Within the **AWS Cluster Profile v1.1.0** code block, the WordPress pack points to `wordpress-variables.yaml`,
which references the cluster profile variables. Additionally, at the end of the code block, you will find the following
cluster profile variables that will be used.

```hcl
profile_variables {
    variable {
      name          = "wordpress_replica"
      display_name  = "Number of replicas"
      format        = "number"
      description   = "The number of WordPress replicas to be deployed."
      default_value = var.wordpress_replica
      required      = true
    }
    variable {
      name          = "wordpress_namespace"
      display_name  = "WordPress: Namespace"
      format        = "string"
      description   = "The namespace for the WordPress pack."
      default_value = var.wordpress_namespace
      required      = true
    }
    variable {
      name          = "wordpress_port"
      display_name  = "WordPress: Port"
      format        = "number"
      description   = "The WordPress HTTP port."
      default_value = var.wordpress_port
      is_sensitive  = true
      required      = true
    }
  }
```

Review the two files in the manifests folder. `wordpress-default.yaml` contains the default configuration for the
WordPress Chart application and `wordpress-variables.yaml` has the following three variables defined in it.

For `namespace: '{{ .spectro.var.wordpress_namespace }}'`, the variable was added to `pack.namespace`.

```hcl {13}
pack:
  #The namespace (on the target cluster) to install this chart
  #When not found, a new namespace will be created
  content:
    images:
      - image: docker.io/bitnami/mariadb:11.2.3-debian-12-r4
      - image: docker.io/bitnami/memcached:1.6.24-debian-12-r0
      - image: docker.io/bitnami/wordpress:6.4.3-debian-12-r16
    charts:
      - repo: https://charts.bitnami.com/wordpress
        name: wordpress
        version: 19.4.3
  namespace: '{{ .spectro.var.wordpress_namespace }}'
  spectrocloud.com/install-priority: 0
```

For `replicaCount: '{{ .spectro.var.wordpress_replica }}'`, the variable was added to `charts.wordpress.replicaCount`.

```hcl {12}
   multisite:
      enable: false
      host: ""
      networkType: subdomain
      enableNipIoRedirect: false
    ## @section WordPress deployment parameters
    ##

    ## @param replicaCount Number of WordPress replicas to deploy
    ## NOTE: ReadWriteMany PVC(s) are required if replicaCount > 1
    ##
    replicaCount: '{{ .spectro.var.wordpress_replica }}'
    ## @param updateStrategy.type WordPress deployment strategy type
    ## ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#strategy
    ## NOTE: Set it to `Recreate` if you use a PV that cannot be mounted on multiple pods
```

For `http: '{{ .spectro.var.wordpress_port }}'`, the variable was added to `charts.wordpress.service.ports.http`.

```hcl {11}
 ## WordPress service parameters
    ##
    service:
      ## @param service.type WordPress service type
      ##
      type: LoadBalancer
      ## @param service.ports.http WordPress service HTTP port
      ## @param service.ports.https WordPress service HTTPS port
      ##
      ports:
        http: '{{ .spectro.var.wordpress_port }}'
        https: 443
      ## @param service.httpsTargetPort Target port for HTTPS
      ##
      httpsTargetPort: https
```

Note that the variable syntax requires spaces at both the beginning and end of the variable, as well as a `.` at the
start of the variable.

### Input Variables

With the references to the variables in place in the YAML file, you can modify their values in **terraform.tfvars**
using the values listed in the following table.

| Variable Name                | New Value          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **WordPress: Replica Count** | `3`                |
| **WordPress: HTTP Port**     | `9090`             |
| **WordPress: Namespace**     | `new-wordpress-ns` |

wordpress_replica   = "REPLACE ME"           # The number of pods to be created for WordPress.
wordpress_namespace = "REPLACE ME"           # The namespace to be created for WordPress.
wordpress_port      = "REPLACE ME"           # The HTTP port to be exposed for WordPress.
```

Additionally, fill in the cloud-specific configurations. If you are using either Azure or GCP, find the relevant
provider section. For this tutorial, the steps will use AWS.

Locate the AWS provider section and change `deploy-aws = false` to `deploy-aws = true`. Additionally, replace all
occurrences of `REPLACE_ME` with their corresponding values, such as those for the `aws-cloud-account-name`,
`aws-region`, `aws-key-pair-name`, and `availability_zones` variables. You can also update the values for the nodes in
the control plane or worker node pools as needed.

```hcl {4,7-9,16,24}
###########################
# AWS Deployment Settings
############################
deploy-aws     = false # Set to true to deploy to AWS.
deploy-aws-var = false # Set to true to deploy to AWS with cluster profile variables.

aws-cloud-account-name = "REPLACE ME"
aws-region             = "REPLACE ME"
aws-key-pair-name      = "REPLACE ME"

aws_control_plane_nodes = {
  count              = "1"
  control_plane      = true
  instance_type      = "m4.2xlarge"
  disk_size_gb       = "60"
  availability_zones = ["REPLACE ME"] # If you want to deploy to multiple AZs, add them here. Example: ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b"].
}

aws_worker_nodes = {
  count              = "1"
  control_plane      = false
  instance_type      = "m4.2xlarge"
  disk_size_gb       = "60"
  availability_zones = ["REPLACE ME"] # If you want to deploy to multiple AZs, add them here. Example: ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b"].
}
```

Save the file after you have finished providing your configurations.

### Deploy Cluster with Cluster Profile Variables

Export your **Palette API key** as an environment variable. This step allows the Terraform CLI to authenticate with the
Palette API.

```bash
export SPECTROCLOUD_APIKEY=<Your-Spectro-Cloud-API-key>
```

:::warning

Before deploying the resources, ensure that there are no active clusters named `aws-profile-var-cluster-tf` or cluster
profiles named `aws-profile-variables-tf` in your Palette project.

:::

Issue the `plan` command to preview the resources that Terraform will create.

```shell
terraform plan
```

The output indicates that three new resources will be created: two versions of the AWS cluster profile and the host
cluster. The host cluster will use version `1.0.0` of the cluster profile.

```shell
Plan: 3 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

To deploy the resources, use the `apply` command.

```shell
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

The cluster deployment takes a few minutes.

Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com), and click **Clusters** from the left main menu.

Navigate to the newly created cluster and select the **Profile** tab. The profile in use should be version **1.0.0**. To
verify that the resources were deployed successfully, you can use either the Palette's UI or the kubectl tool.

<Tabs groupId="cluster-deployment-verification">

<TabItem label="kubectl" value="Access Cluster with CLI">
From the left main menu, select **Clusters**. Then, select the cluster you created in this tutorial. Select the **Overview** tab, navigate to the middle column containing cluster details and locate the **Kubernetes Config File** row.

Click on the **Admin Kubeconfig File** link to download the file.

![Image that shows how to download kubeconfig file](/tutorials/deploy-cluster-profile-variables/clusters_cluster-management_deploy-cluster-profile-variables-download-kubeconfig-tf.webp)

Open a terminal window and set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to the file path of the kubeconfig file.

Example:

```shell title="Example"
export KUBECONFIG=~/Downloads/admin.aws-profile-var-tf.kubeconfig
```

Use the following command to get a listing of the default pod deployment for the Wordpress app. Three pods are displayed
similar to the following output: one for MariaDB, one for WordPress database memory cache and one for the WordPress web
server. The row highlighted in the output is an example of the Wordpress web server.

```shell
kubectl get pods --namespace wordpress
```

```shell title="Example Output" {2}
NAME                                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

<TabItem label="Palette UI" value="Palette UI Workloads">
Navigate to the **Workloads** tab. Then, select **Pods** and filter for `wordpress`. Three pods are displayed similar to the following screenshot: one for MariaDB, one for WordPress database
memory cache, and one for the WordPress web server. This is the default deployment behavior for the WordPress pack.

Return to your terminal window and modify the `terraform.tfvars` file so that `deploy-aws-var` is set to `true`. This
updates the cluster to use version 1.1.0 of the cluster profile, which contains the cluster profile variables.

```hcl {12}
##############################
# Application Configuration
##############################
wordpress_replica   = 3 # The number of pods to be created for Wordpress.
wordpress_namespace = "new-wordpress-ns" # The namespace to be created for Wordpress.
wordpress_port      = 9090 # The port to be created for HTTP for Wordpress.

############################
# AWS Deployment Settings
############################
deploy-aws     = true # Set to true to deploy to AWS.
deploy-aws-var = true # Set to true to deploy AWS with WordPress Pack and cluster profile variables
```

Issue the `plan` command to preview the resources that Terraform will create.

```shell
terraform plan
```

The output indicates that one resource, the cluster, will be modified. This will create a new namespace and three new
replicas for WordPress under the new namespace, without deleting the existing resources. The host cluster will use
version `1.1.0` of the cluster profile.

```shell
Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

To modify the cluster profile, use the `apply` command.

```shell
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

The cluster modification will take a few minutes.

Return to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com), and click **Clusters** from the left main menu.

Navigate to your cluster and select the **Profile** tab. The profile in use should be **1.1.0**. To verify that the
resources were deployed successfully, you can use either the Palette's UI or the kubectl tool.

### Cleanup

Use the following steps to clean up the resources you created for the tutorial. Use the `destroy` command to remove all
the resources you created through Terraform.

```shell
terraform destroy --auto-approve
````

A successful execution of `terraform destroy` will output the following.

```shell
Destroy complete! Resources: 3 destroyed.
```

:::info

If a cluster remains in the delete phase for over 15 minutes, it becomes eligible for force delete. To trigger a force
delete action, navigate to the cluster’s details page and click on **Settings**. Click on **Force Delete Cluster** to
delete the cluster. Palette automatically removes clusters stuck in the cluster deletion phase for over 24 hours.

## Wrap-Up

In this tutorial, you created two cluster profile versions, one with cluster profile variables and one without. You
deployed a cluster and updated it to apply the cluster profile variables. Cluster profile variables provide the ability
to leverage cluster profiles as a templating function.

We encourage you to check out the following reference resources to learn more about Palette.
