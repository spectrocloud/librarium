Multi-cluster environments create administration and maintenance challenges as they grow.

- _Operational Efficiency_: Increased manual work hours to maintain and update the environment as more clusters are
  built.

- _Build Consistency_: New clusters may be built with a profile different from their counterparts. This could impact
  performance of hosted services or cause them to fail.

- _Configuration Drift_: Clusters needing matching configurations may not receive them simultaneously. This could impact
  performance of hosted services or cause them to fail.

Palette provides cluster profiles, which allow you to specify layers for your workloads using packs, Helm charts, Zarf
packages, or cluster manifests. Packs serve as blueprints to the provisioning and deployment process, as they contain
the versions of the container images that Palette will install for you. Cluster profiles provide consistency across
environments during the cluster creation process and when maintaining your clusters. Check out the
[cluster profiles](../../../profiles/cluster-profiles/cluster-profiles.md) section to learn more about creating and
using them.

This tutorial will teach you how to update a cluster deployed with Palette to Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft
Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) cloud providers. You will explore each cluster update method and learn how to
apply these changes using Palette or Terraform.

:::warning

Palette has backup and restore capabilities available for your mission-critical workloads. Ensure you have adequate
backups before making any cluster profile version changes in your production environments. You can learn more in the
[Backup and Restore](../../../clusters/cluster-management/backup-restore/backup-restore.md) section.

:::

## Prerequisites

- An active Palette cluster. This tutorial builds upon steps in [Getting Started](../../../getting-started/getting-started.md). Complete the steps
for your preferred cloud provider. 
  - [Deploy a Cluster with Azure](/getting-started/azure/deploy-k8s-cluster.md)
  - [Deploy a Cluster with AWS](/getting-started/aws/deploy-k8s-cluster.md)
  - [Deploy a Cluster with GCP](/getting-started/gcp/deploy-k8s-cluster.md)
  - [Deploy a Cluster with VMware](/getting-started/vmware/deploy-k8s-cluster.md)

## Set Up Cluster

After completing the prerequisites, your cluster should be successfully provisioned, in a healthy state, and the
[_hello-universe_](https://github.com/spectrocloud/hello-universe) application be installed and functional.

In Palette, navigate to the left main menu and select **Clusters**. Select the cluster you created in the Getting
Started tutorials.

Select the URL link for port **:8080** to access the Hello Universe application.

## Create Cluster Profile Versions

Palette supports the creation of multiple cluster profile versions using the same profile name. This gives you better
change visibility and control over the layers in your host clusters. Profile versions are commonly used to add or remove
layers and pack configuration updates.

The version number of a given profile must be unique and use the semantic versioning format `major.minor.patch`. If you
do not specify a version for your cluster profile, it will default to **1.0.0**.

In Palette, navigate to the left main menu and select **Profiles** to view the cluster profile page.

Select the cluster profile created during setup from the list of profiles displayed in the left main menu.

The current profile version is displayed in the drop-down menu beside the profile name. This profile has the default
value of **1.0.0**, as you did not specify another value when you created it. The cluster profile also shows the host
clusters currently deployed with this cluster profile version.

Select the version drop-down menu and choose the **Create new version** option.

![Image that shows the profile management screen](/tutorials/deploy-cluster-profile-updates/clusters_cluster-management_deploy-cluster-profile-updates_create-new-profile-version-ui.webp)

A dialog box appears. Fill in the **Version** input with **1.1.0**. Select **Confirm**.

Palette creates and opens the new cluster profile version on your screen. The version drop-down menu now displays the
newly created **1.1.0** profile. This version has the same packs as version 1.0.0, which it was created from.

Select **Add New Pack**.

![Image that shows the profile management screen](/tutorials/deploy-cluster-profile-updates/clusters_cluster-management_deploy-cluster-profile-updates_profile-add-new-pack-ui.webp)

Search the **Palette Community Registry** for the **Kubecost** pack and select it.

The next screen shows the configurations the pack will apply to your cluster. No changes to the manifest are required
for this tutorial. Select **Confirm & Create** to continue.

![Image that shows the pack search screen with inputs to find Kubecost pack](/tutorials/deploy-cluster-profile-updates/clusters_cluster-management_deploy-cluster-profile-updates_kubcost-pack-details-ui.webp)

Confirm the changes you made. The configuration stack diagram should show the cost-analyzer pack with Kubecost at the
top.

Select **Save Changes** to confirm your updates.

![Image that shows the new version of the cluster profile](/tutorials/deploy-cluster-profile-updates/clusters_cluster-management_deploy-cluster-profile-updates_confirm-new-pack-version-ui.webp)

## Deploy Cluster Profile Version Updates

Navigate to the left main menu and select **Clusters**. Select the cluster you created in the Getting Started tutorials.

Select the **Profile** tab. This cluster is currently deployed using cluster profile version **1.0.0**. Select the
option **1.1.0** in the version drop-down menu. The Kubecost pack will now be displayed in the profile pack list. Select
**Save** to confirm your changes.

![Image that shows how to select a new profile version for the cluster](/tutorials/deploy-cluster-profile-updates/clusters_cluster-management_deploy-cluster-profile-updates_profile-version-selection.webp)

Palette now applies the configuration changes specified in version **1.1.0** of your cluster profile. Once your changes
are complete, Palette marks your layers with the green status indicator. Select the **Overview** tab to verify that the
Kubecost pack was installed successfully.

![Image that shows the new cluster profile with Kubecost functional.](/tutorials/deploy-cluster-profile-updates/clusters_cluster-management_deploy-cluster-profile-updates_deployed-profile-version.webp)

The Kubecost pack is not automatically accessible. To access the Kubecost UI, you must create a port forward the
application deployed in the Kubernetes cluster.

Download the kubeconfig file for your cluster from the Palette UI. This file enables you to issue kubectl commands
against the host cluster.

![Image that shows the new cluster profile with Kubecost functional.](/tutorials/deploy-cluster-profile-updates/clusters_cluster-management_deploy-cluster-profile-updates_download-kube-config.webp)

Open a new terminal window and set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to use the kubeconfig file you downloaded.

```shell
export KUBECONFIG=~/Downloads/admin.aws-cluster.kubeconfig
```

Execute the command below to forward the Kubecost UI port to your local network. If port 9090 is already in use, choose
a different port number.

```shell
kubectl port-forward --namespace kubecost deployment/cost-analyzer-cost-analyzer 9090
```

Open a browser window and navigate to `http://localhost:9090`.

## Roll back Cluster Profiles

One of the key advantages of using cluster profile versions is that they make it possible to maintain a copy of
previously known working states. The ability to roll back to a previously working cluster profile in one action shortens
the time to recovery in the event of an incident.

The process to roll back to a previous version is identical to the process to apply a new version.

In Palette, navigate to the left main menu and select **Clusters**. Select the cluster you created in the **Getting
Started** tutorial.

Select the **Profile** tab. The cluster is currently deployed using cluster profile version **1.1.0**. Select version
**1.0.0** in the version drop-down menu. The Kubecost pack will no longer be displayed in the profile pack list. Select
**Save** to confirm your changes.

Palette now makes the changes required for the cluster to update the cluster to the configuration specified in version
**1.0.0** of your cluster profile. When the changes complete successfully, Palette will mark your layers with a green
status indicator. Select the **Overview** tab to verify that the Kubecost pack was successfully removed.

Execute the commands below in your terminal to verify the Kubecost pack and all configurations were removed entirely.

Confirm that all pods deployed in the `kubecost` namespace have been removed.

```shell
kubectl get pods --namespace kubecost
```

The command will return the below response, confirming all Kubecost pods have been removed.

```shell
No resources found in kubecost namespace.
```

Confirm the namespace created by the pack was removed by using the command below.

```shell
kubectl get --namespace kubecost
```

Your result should be the same as the one below.

```shell
Error from server (NotFound): namespaces "kubecost" not found
```

## Cluster Profile Overrides

Cluster profiles can be updated and applied to one specific cluster. This method is referred to as a profile override.
When using this method, the previous state of the cluster profile will not be saved. This method will only push changes
to the cluster you specify. All other clusters using the specific profile and version will not be impacted.

Navigate to the left main menu and select **Clusters**. Select the cluster you created in the Getting Started tutorials.

Select the **Profile** tab. Then, select the **hello-universe** pack. Change the value of the `replicas` field to `2`.
Select **Save**. The editor closes.

Palette uses the profile override configuration you provided and begins making changes immediately. Select the
**Overview** tab and wait for the **hello-universe** deployment status to turn green.

Once these changes are complete, select the **Workloads** tab. Then, select **Namespaces** and select the
**hello-universe** namespace.

Two replicas of the **UI** deployment are available instead of the one initially specified by your cluster profile. The
Palette UI may take some time to update the change. Select the **refresh** icon next to the time duration drop-down menu
to force a refresh. Your override has been successfully applied.

![Image that shows the new cluster profile with Kubecost functional.](/tutorials/deploy-cluster-profile-updates/clusters_cluster-management_deploy-cluster-profile-updates_profile-override.webp)

## In Place Cluster Profile Updates

Cluster profiles can be updated in place. When a profile version is updated, all clusters using it will display a
notification that updates are available. Profile changes made using this method do not immediately apply. This allows
you to schedule the work around maintenance windows for each impacted cluster.

Navigate to the left main menu and select **Profiles**. Select the profile you created in the Getting Started tutorials.

Select **1.0.0** in the version drop-down menu.

Select the **hello-universe** manifest. The editor appears. Change the value of the `replicas` field to `3`. Select
**Confirm Updates**. The editor closes.

Select **Save Changes** to confirm the changes you have made to your profile.

Navigate to the left main menu and select **Clusters**. Palette indicates clusters have updates pending by placing a
green icon in the **Type** column.

![Image that shows the pending updates ](/tutorials/deploy-cluster-profile-updates/clusters_cluster-management_deploy-cluster-profile-updates_pending-update-clusters-view.webp)

Select the cluster you created in the Getting Started tutorial, then select the **Overview** tab. Select **Updates** to
begin the cluster update.

![Image that shows the Updates button](/tutorials/deploy-cluster-profile-updates/clusters_cluster-management_deploy-cluster-profile-updates_updates-available-button-cluster-overview.webp)

A dialogue box appears that shows the packs with changes pending. Select **Review Changes in Editor**.

Palette displays the details of the pending changes, with the current configuration on the left and the incoming
configuration on the right.

Review the changes and ensure the `replicas` field value is the only change. You can choose to apply the modified
profile be selecting **Apply Changes** or decline it by selecting **Cancel**.

Select **Apply Changes** once you have finished reviewing your changes.

![Image that shows the available updates dialog ](/tutorials/deploy-cluster-profile-updates/clusters_cluster-management_deploy-cluster-profile-updates_reivew-updates-dialog.webp)

:::warning

You have just applied an updated profile to a cluster that had a profile override in place. When doing this, **any
configurations** in the profile override **will be replaced** with those in the updated profile.

:::

Palette updates your cluster according to cluster profile specifications. Monitor the progress of the update on the
**Cluster Overview** screen. When these changes are complete, select the **Workloads** tab. Then, select the
**hello-universe** namespace.

Three replicas of the **UI** deployment are available instead of the one specified by your cluster profile. The Palette
The UI may take some time to display the changes. If needed, select the **refresh** icon next to the **time interval**
drop-down menu to force a refresh.

## Cleanup

Use the following steps to clean up the resources you created for the tutorials.

Navigate to the left main menu and select **Clusters**. Select the cluster you created in the Getting Started tutorials.

Select **Settings** to expand the menu, and select **Delete Cluster**.

A dialog appears. Input the cluster name to confirm the delete action.

The deletion process takes several minutes to complete. Repeat the same steps for any other cluster you created.

Once the clusters are deleted, navigate to the left main menu and select **Profiles**.

Select the cluster profile you created in the Getting Started tutorials. Select the three-dot menu to display the
**Delete** button.

Select **Delete** and confirm the selection to remove the cluster profile. Make sure you delete both versions of this
profile.

## Wrap-Up

In this tutorial, you updated a cluster profile using three different methods: create a new cluster profile version,
cluster profile override, and update a cluster profile in place. You deployed and rolled back the Kubecost application
and modified configuration of the **_hello-universe_** deployment using cluster profile updates.

Cluster profiles provide consistency during the cluster creation process and when maintaining your clusters. They can be
versioned to store previously working cluster states, giving you visibility when updating or rolling back workloads
across your environments.
