Palette Edge allows users to deploy Kubernetes workloads in remote locations with limited connectivity and compute
infrastructure. This means you can use Palette to manage the lifecycle of your Kubernetes clusters at the edge in places
such as hospitals, rural areas, restaurants, and more.

Edge clusters are Kubernetes clusters set up on Edge hosts, which can be bare metal or virtual machines. These hosts can
be managed locally on-site through the [Local UI](../../clusters/edge/local-ui/local-ui.md) or centrally through the
Palette management plane.

Before forming a cluster, the Edge hosts must be prepared and registered with Palette. This involves the
[EdgeForge workflow](../../clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/edgeforge-workflow.md), which is responsible for building
the required Edge artifacts, such as the
[Installer ISO](../../clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/palette-canvos/build-installer-iso.md) and
[Provider Images](../../clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/palette-canvos/build-provider-images.md). Once these artifacts
are built, you can use the Installer ISO to bootstrap the Edge installation on your Edge host and the Provider Images to
create a cluster profile.

This tutorial will help you understand how the different Edge components work together. You will build and test the Edge
artifacts and deploy an Edge cluster without the need for a complex lab environment or separate physical devices.
Specifically, you will learn to deploy an Edge cluster along with a demo application using a VirtualBox VM as the Edge
host.

The diagram below illustrates how the components that will be deployed in this tutorial interact with each other.

![A diagram showing the Edge VirtualBox tutorial workflow.](/tutorials/edge-vbox/tutorials_edge-vbox_deploy-cluster-virtualbox_diagram.webp)

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you will need the following prerequisites in place.

- A host with _AMD64_ (also known as _x86_64_) processor architecture and access to the Internet. The host must meet the
  [minimum requirements](../../clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/palette-canvos/build-installer-iso.md#prerequisites) to
  build the artifacts and allow the creation of a VM with the following specifications:
  - 2 CPU
  - 8 GB memory
  - 100 GB storage
- A DHCP-enabled network.
- Three available IP addresses on the same network as the host machine. One address is for the Edge host, one is for the
  cluster's Virtual IP (VIP) address, and one is for the MetalLB load balancer.
- A [Palette account](https://www.spectrocloud.com/get-started) with
  [tenant admin](../../tenant-settings/tenant-settings.md) access.
- A Palette tenant registration token. Refer to the
  [Create a Registration Token](../../clusters/edge/site-deployment/site-installation/create-registration-token.md)
  guide for instructions on how to create a token.
- The following software installed:
  - A text editor such as Vi or Nano. This tutorial uses Vi as an example.
  - [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) with `sudo` privileges. Alternatively, you can install
    [Earthly](https://earthly.dev/), in which case you will not need `sudo` privileges. And you can use lighter image
    management tools like [crane](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/blob/main/cmd/crane/README.md) instead
    of Docker.
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) version 7.0

## EdgeForge Workflow

The first step to deploying an Edge cluster is to prepare your Edge host with all the required components. This process
is called [EdgeForge](../../clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/edgeforge-workflow.md) and uses the
[CanvOS](https://github.com/spectrocloud/CanvOS/blob/main/README.md) utility. In this section, you will build the
Installer ISO and provider images Edge artifacts.

- Installer ISO: ISO file that contains the Palette Edge host agent and metadata. It bootstraps the Edge installation in
  your Edge host.
- Provider Images: [Kairos-based](https://kairos.io) images containing the OS and the desired Kubernetes versions. The
  provider images are used in the OS layer when creating an Edge cluster profile.

:::tip

If you want your Edge host to have preloaded content and be able to create clusters using this content, you can create a
[content bundle](../../clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/palette-canvos/build-content-bundle.md) and build it into your
Installer ISO.

:::

### Setup Your Local Environment

Open up a terminal window in your host machine and clone the **CanvOS** repository. This repository contains the code
and scripts required to build Edge artifacts.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/spectrocloud/CanvOS.git
```

Next, navigate to the **CanvOS** directory.

```shell
cd CanvOS
```

Check the available git tags.

```shell
git tag
```

Check out the newest available tag. This tutorial uses the tag **v4.4.12** as an example.

```
git checkout v4.4.12
```

### Define Arguments

EdgeForge leverages [Earthly](https://earthly.dev/)(https://earthly.dev) to build the Installer ISO and provider images
artifacts. The **.arg** file is used to pass the values of a few arguments, such as the image tag and registry name, to
Earthly for the build process.

Execute the command below to create a custom tag for the provider images. The tag must be an alphanumeric lowercase
string. This tutorial uses `vbox-tutorial` as an example.

```bash
export CUSTOM_TAG=vbox-tutorial
```

Next, issue the following command to create the **.arg** file with the custom tag. The other arguments will use the
predefined values. For example, [K3s](https://k3s.io/) will be defined as the Kubernetes distribution, Ubuntu as the OS
distribution, and [ttl.sh](https://ttl.sh/) as the image registry.

```bash
cat << EOF > .arg
CUSTOM_TAG=$CUSTOM_TAG
IMAGE_REGISTRY=ttl.sh
OS_DISTRIBUTION=ubuntu
IMAGE_REPO=ubuntu
OS_VERSION=22
K8S_DISTRIBUTION=k3s
ISO_NAME=palette-installer
ARCH=amd64
UPDATE_KERNEL=false
EOF
```

Verify that the file was created correctly using the `cat` command.

```
cat .arg
```

:::info

Different versions of CanvOS may require different arguments. Refer to the
[CanvOS](https://github.com/spectrocloud/CanvOS#readme) repository to learn more about the required arguments for each
version tag.

:::

### Create User Data

Once the **.arg** file is ready, the next step is to create a
[**user-data**](../../clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/prepare-user-data.md) file, which allows you to provide
customized configuration to the Edge Installer ISO. In this tutorial, the file will be used to embed the Palette
registration token, Palette endpoint, and Edge host login information into the Edge Installer ISO. The login credentials
allow you to SSH into your Edge host.

Export your Palette registration token.

```bash
export TOKEN=<your-palette-registration-token>
```

Then, issue the command below to create the **user-data** file using the token.

```bash
cat << EOF > user-data
#cloud-config
stylus:
  site:
    edgeHostToken: $TOKEN
    paletteEndpoint: api.spectrocloud.com

users:
  - name: kairos
    passwd: kairos
EOF
```

Confirm that the file was created correctly.

```bash
cat user-data
```

The output should contain the value of your Palette registration token assigned to the `edgeHostToken` parameter, as
displayed in the example output below.

```text hideClipboard
#cloud-config
stylus:
  site:
    paletteEndpoint: api.spectrocloud.com
    edgeHostToken: ****************

users:
  - name: kairos
    passwd: kairos
```

### Build Edge Artifacts

By default, Earthly builds multiple images with different K3s Kubernetes versions. You can exclude the image versions
you do not need from the build process by deleting the lines under the `k3s` section in the **k8s_version.json** file.
This will speed up the build process and reduce the amount of space that is required from your host machine.

Open the **k8s_version.json** file with an editor of your choice.

```bash
vi k8s_version.json
```

Next, delete the K3s versions you do not need. This tutorial uses K3s version `1.29.6`. Below is an example of the file
with all other versions deleted.

```text {18} hideClipboard
{
  "k3s": [
    "1.29.6"
  ],

  ...

}
```

Once you are done making the alterations, save and exit the file.

:::warning

If you are using a CanvOS tag that is earlier than v4.4.12, the **k8s_version.json** file does not exist in those tags.
Instead, open the **Earthfile** in the CanvOS directory. Under `build-provider-images`, remove the lines containing
Kubernetes versions that you do not need.

:::

Next, execute the command below to build the Edge Installer ISO and provider images artifacts.

```bash
sudo ./earthly.sh +build-all-images
```

The build may take 15 to 20 minutes to complete, depending on the hardware resources available on the host machine. Once
finished, you get a success message similar to the one displayed below.

```text hideClipboard
# Lines omitted for readability
========================== üåç Earthly Build  ‚úÖ SUCCESS ==========================
```

The output also includes a manifest with predefined parameters that are required to create the cluster profile. Copy and
save the manifest, as you will need it later.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml

  system.osName: ubuntu
  system.peVersion: v4.4.12
  system.customTag: vbox-tutorial
  system.osVersion: 22
```

Once the build is complete, confirm that the Edge Installer ISO and its checksum were created correctly.

```bash
ls build
```

```text hideClipboard
palette-installer.iso
palette-installer.iso.sha256
```

List the container images to confirm that the provider images were built successfully.

```bash
docker images --filter=reference="*/*:*$CUSTOM_TAG"
```

```text hideClipboard
REPOSITORY      TAG                               IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE

```

### Push Provider Images

Push the provider images to the [ttl.sh](https://ttl.sh/) registry so that you can reference it when creating the
cluster profile.

```bash
docker push ttl.sh/ubuntu:k3s-1.29.6-v4.4.12-$CUSTOM_TAG
```

The output confirms that the image was pushed to the registry with the correct tag.

```text hideClipboard
# Lines omitted for readability
k3s-1.29.6-v4.4.12-vbox-tutorial: digest: sha256:42f8805830c7fd3816bb27e8d710d1747fea31a70cb7718d74e42fe1c0ed53ac size: 17815
```

:::warning

[ttl.sh](https://ttl.sh/) is free and does not require you to sign in to use it. However, this is a short-lived image
registry, which means that the pushed images will expire after 24 hours. Refer to the
[Build Edge Artifacts](../../clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/palette-canvos/palette-canvos.md) guide to learn how to
push images to a different registry.

:::

## Create Cluster Profile

Once the provider images are available in the registry, create the cluster profile.

Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com/). Then, select **Profiles** from the left **Main Menu**. Click
**Add Cluster Profile** to create a cluster profile.

Follow the wizard to create a new profile.

In the **Basic Information** section, assign the name **edge-vbox-profile** and a brief profile description, select the
type as **Full**, and assign the tag **env:edge**. You can leave the version empty if you want to. Just be aware that
the version defaults to **1.0.0**. Click on **Next**.

The **Cloud Type** section allows you to choose the infrastructure provider for the cluster. Select **Edge Native** and
click **Next**.

The **Profile Layers** section specifies the packs that compose the profile.

Add the **BYOS Edge OS** pack to the OS layer.

| **Pack Name** | **Version** | **Registry** | **Layer**        |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| BYOS Edge OS  | 1.0.0       | Public Repo  | Operating System |

Replace the layer manifest with the custom manifest you built in the [Build Edge Artifacts](#build-edge-artifacts)
section. This will make the cluster profile pull the provider images from the _ttl.sh_ registry. The image below
displays the OS layer with the custom manifest.

![A screenshot of the cluster profile creation step with the OS layer.](/tutorials/edge-vbox/tutorials_edge-vbox_deploy-cluster-virtualbox_byos-cluster-profile.webp)

Click **Next Layer** to proceed to the next layer. Add the following Kubernetes layer to your cluster profile. The
Kubernetes version must match the version used in the provider images.

| **Pack Name**         | **Version** | **Registry** | **Layer**  |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Palette Optimized K3S | 1.29.6      | Public Repo  | Kubernetes |

Click **Values** under **Pack Details**, and replace the predefined **cluster-cidr** and **service-cidr** IP CIDRs if
they overlap with your network. For example, you can set the **cluster-cidr** parameter to `"100.64.0.0/18"` and
**service-cidr** to `"100.64.64.0/18"`. This prevents any routing conflicts in the internal pod networking.

![A screenshot of the cluster profile creation step with the Kubernetes layer.](/tutorials/edge-vbox/tutorials_edge-vbox_deploy-cluster-virtualbox_cluster-profile-k8s.webp)

Click **Next Layer** to add the network layer. This tutorial uses Cilium as an example.

| **Pack Name** | **Version** | **Registry** | **Layer** |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------ | --------- |
| Cilium        | 1.15.3      | Public Repo  | Network   |

Click **Confirm** after you have completed filling out all the core layers.

Next, to add the add-on layers, click **Add New Pack** and search for **MetalLB**. Add the following pack to your
cluster profile.

| **Pack Name**  | **Version** | **Registry** | **Layer**     |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| MetalLB (Helm) | 0.14.8      | Public Repo  | Load Balancer |

The MetalLB pack provides a load-balancer implementation for your Edge Kubernetes cluster. The load balancer is required
to help the _LoadBalancer_ service specified in the Hello Universe pack obtain an IP address, so that you can access the
demo application from your browser.

Click **Values** under **Pack Details** and replace the predefined `192.168.10.0/24` IP CIDR listed below the
**addresses** line with a valid IP address or IP range from your network. Next, click **Confirm & Create** to add the
MetalLB pack.

![A screenshot of the cluster profile creation step with the MetalLB layer.](/tutorials/edge-vbox/tutorials_edge-vbox_deploy-cluster-virtualbox_cluster-profile-metallb.webp)

Finally, click **Add New Pack** again and search for the Hello Universe pack.

| **Pack Name**  | **Version** | **Registry**               | **Layer**   |
| -------------- | ----------- | -------------------------- | ----------- |
| Hello Universe | 1.1.2       | Palette Community Registry | Application |

Once you select the pack, Palette will display its README file, providing additional guidance on usage and configuration
options. This pack deploys the [hello-universe](https://github.com/spectrocloud/hello-universe) application.

Click on **Values** under the **Pack Details** section. Next, click on **Presets** on the right-hand side.

This pack has two configured presets:

1. **Disable Hello Universe API** configures the hello-universe application as a standalone front-end application. This
   is the default preset selection.
2. **Enable Hello Universe API** configures the hello-universe application as a three-tier application with a frontend,
   API server, and Postgres database.

Select the **Enable Hello Universe API** preset. The pack manifest changes according to this preset.

The pack requires two values to be replaced for the authorization token and for the database password when using this
preset. Replace these values with your own base64 encoded values. The
[hello-universe](https://github.com/spectrocloud/hello-universe?tab=readme-ov-file#single-load-balancer) repository
provides a token that you can use.

:::tip

You can use the `base64` command to create a base64 encoded value.

```shell
echo "mypassword" | base64
```

The output contains your base64 encoded value.

```text hideClipboard
bXlwYXNzd29yZAo=
```

:::

![A screenshot of the cluster profile creation step with the Hello Universe layer.](/tutorials/edge-vbox/tutorials_edge-vbox_deploy-cluster-virtualbox_cluster-profile-hellouni.webp)

Click **Confirm & Create** to save the alterations and add the pack to your cluster profile.

Click **Next**. If there are no compatibility issues, Palette displays the cluster profile for review. Verify the layers
you added are correct, and click on **Finish Configuration** to create the cluster profile.

## Deploy VirtualBox VM

Once the Edge artifacts and cluster profile have been created, proceed to the VM deployment. The VirtualBox VM will use
the Installer ISO to bootstrap the Edge installation and serve as the Edge host for your cluster.

Launch the VirtualBox application and click **New** to create a new VM.

Give the machine a name, for example, `edge-vm`.

In the **ISO Image** field, select the Edge Installer ISO file you built in the
[Build Edge Artifacts](#build-edge-artifacts) section. The ISO file is stored in the `CanvOS/build` folder.

Set the machine **Type** as `Linux` and the **Version** as `Ubuntu (64-bit)`, and click **Next**.

![A screenshot of the VirtualBox VM configuration.](/tutorials/edge-vbox/tutorials_edge-vbox_deploy-cluster-virtualbox_vm-config.webp)

Adjust the **Base Memory** to `8000 MB` and **Processors** to `2 CPU`. Click **Next** to proceed.

Set the **Disk Size** to 100 GB and ensure the option **Pre-Allocate Full Size** is **not** checked. Click **Next**.

:::info

These are the minimum hardware requirements for an Edge host. In production environments, the required configuration may
vary.

:::

Confirm the VM settings and click **Finish** to create the VM.

Select the VM to adjust its network settings. Click **Settings** and select **Network**.

Change the **Attached to:** option from `NAT` to `Bridged Adapter` so that the VM can receive an IP address from the
same network as the host machine's network. Click **OK**.

![A screenshot of the VirtualBox VM network configuration.](/tutorials/edge-vbox/tutorials_edge-vbox_deploy-cluster-virtualbox_vm-network.webp)

## Prepare Edge Host

### Install Palette Edge

In VirtualBox, select the created VM and click **Start** to turn it on. The Edge Installer will bootstrap the Palette
Edge installation onto the VM.

Wait for the Edge Installer to complete copying content to the VM, which may take a few minutes. The VM will reboot upon
completion. Ensure that you stop the VM before the reboot proceeds.

When the image below appears for the second time, right-click the VM, select **Stop**, and then click **Power Off** to
turn it off.

![A screenshot of the VirtualBox VM after installation.](/tutorials/edge-vbox/tutorials_edge-vbox_deploy-cluster-virtualbox_vm-reboot.webp)

Next, click **Settings** and select **Storage**.

Select the Edge Installer ISO and click **Remove Attachment** to remove it from your VM. Confirm the deletion with
**Remove** and click **OK** to close the settings window.

![A screenshot of the VirtualBox VM storage configuration.](/tutorials/edge-vbox/tutorials_edge-vbox_deploy-cluster-virtualbox_vm-remove-iso.webp)

### Register Edge Host

Select the VirtualBox VM you created and click **Start** to turn it on. The VM will boot and get an IP address from the
bridged network of the host machine. This address should be on the same subnet as the host machine.

After a few minutes, the VM screen displays an IP address and registers automatically in Palette as an Edge host using
the provided Palette registration token.

![A screenshot of the Edge host.](/tutorials/edge-vbox/tutorials_edge-vbox_deploy-cluster-virtualbox_edge-host.webp)

### Validate the Edge Host Registration

Navigate back to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com/). Then, select **Clusters** from the left **Main Menu**.
Click on the **Edge Hosts** tab to view the registered hosts.

Confirm your Edge host is listed as **Healthy** and with a **Ready** status. The **Machine ID** should match the ID
displayed on your VM's screen.

![A screenshot of the Edge host in Palette.](/tutorials/edge-vbox/tutorials_edge-vbox_deploy-cluster-virtualbox_edge-host-palette.webp)

## Deploy Edge Cluster

From the left **Main Menu**, select **Clusters**, then click **Create Cluster**. If you already have clusters deployed,
click **Add New Cluster** instead. Ensure you are in the **Default** project.

Palette will prompt you to select the type of cluster. Select **Edge Native** and click the **Start Edge Native
Configuration** button.

In the **Basic Information** section, assign the name **edge-vbox-cluster**, a brief cluster description, and assign the
tag **env:edge**. Click **Next**.

In the **Cluster Profile** section, click **Add Cluster Profile**. Select the cluster profile you created earlier in
this tutorial and click **Confirm**.

Review the cluster profile layers, then click **Next** to proceed.

In the **Cluster Config** section, provide a Virtual IP (VIP) address for the Edge cluster. This address must be an
unused address on the same network as your Edge host.

:::tip

You can use the [nmap](https://nmap.org/book/man.html) tool to scan your network and check which IP addresses are in
use. Issue the following command in your terminal, replacing the example CIDR `192.168.0.0/24` with your network's CIDR.

    ```bash
    nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24
    ```

The output displays the IP addresses that are currently in use on your network.

:::

Optionally, you can also select an SSH key to access the cluster's nodes and a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server list.

Click **Next** to continue.

In the **Nodes Config** section, specify what Edge hosts make up the Edge cluster. This tutorial deploys a single-node
Edge cluster with no worker pools.

Provide the following details for the control plane pool.

| Field                           | Value                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Pool Configuration > Edge Hosts | Choose the registered Edge hosts you created in the [Register Edge Host](#register-edge-host) section of this tutorial. Palette automatically displays the NIC Name for the selected host. |

Next, click **Remove** to delete the worker pool and click **Next** to proceed with the cluster deployment.

![A screenshot of the nodes config during cluster deployment.](/tutorials/edge-vbox/tutorials_edge-vbox_deploy-cluster-virtualbox_cluster-deployment-nodes.webp)

The **Cluster Settings** section provides advanced options for OS patching, scheduled scans, scheduled backups, and
cluster role binding. For this tutorial, you can use the default settings. Click on **Validate** to continue.

Finally, the **Review** section allows you to review the cluster configuration. If everything looks correct, click
**Finish Configuration** to deploy the cluster.

The cluster deployment can take 15 to 30 minutes, depending on its configuration. You can click on the **Events** tab to
visualize the event log and learn more about the deployment progress.

## Validate

In Palette, select **Clusters** from the left **Main Menu**.

Next, click on your cluster to view its **Overview** tab.

Confirm that your cluster has a **Running** status and is listed as **Healthy**.

When the Hello Universe application is deployed and ready for network traffic, Palette exposes the service URL in the

## Clean Up

You have successfully provisioned an Edge cluster with a three-tier demo application. Use the following steps to remove
the resources created for this tutorial.

### Cluster and Cluster Profile

To remove the Edge cluster, log in to Palette and click **Clusters** from the left **Main Menu**. Click on the cluster
named **edge-vbox-cluster** to access its details page.

Next, click **Settings** and select **Delete Cluster**.

Type in the cluster name to proceed with the deletion. This process may take several minutes to complete.

:::info

If a cluster remains in the delete phase for over 15 minutes, it becomes eligible for a force delete. To trigger a force
delete, navigate to the cluster‚Äôs details page, click on **Settings**, then select **Force Delete Cluster**. Palette
automatically removes clusters stuck in the cluster deletion phase for over 24 hours.

:::

After deleting your Edge cluster, proceed with the cluster profile deletion.

Click **Profiles** from the left **Main Menu**. Select the **edge-vbox-profile** cluster profile, and then click on the
**three-dot Menu** to display the **Delete** button. Click **Delete** and confirm the selection to remove the cluster
profile.

### Edge Host

Once the Edge cluster and cluster profile are deleted, click **Clusters** from the left **Main Menu**.

Locate the Edge host deployed in the [Register Edge Host](#register-edge-host) section of this tutorial. Click on the
**three-dot Menu** and select **Delete** to delete the Edge host. Confirm the deletion by clicking **OK**. This will
remove the Edge host from Palette but not delete the underlying infrastructure.

To delete the VM, open the **VirtualBox** application on your host machine.

Right-click the `edge-vm` VM and select **Stop**. Then, click **Power Off** to turn the machine off.

Next, right-click the VM again and select **Remove**. Click **Delete all files** to delete the VM and its hard disk.

### Edge Artifacts

Delete the Edge Installer ISO image and its checksum by issuing the following commands from the **CanvOS/** directory.

```bash
rm build/palette-installer.iso
rm build/palette-installer.iso.sha256
```

Next, delete the provider images.

```bash
docker rmi ttl.sh/ubuntu:k3s-1.29.6-v4.4.12-vbox-tutorial
docker rmi ttl.sh/ubuntu:k3s-1.29.6-v4.4.12-vbox-tutorial_linux_amd64
```

## Wrap-up

In this tutorial, you successfully deployed a single-node Edge cluster along with a demo application using a VirtualBox
VM as the Edge host. You learned how to build and test Edge artifacts, prepare an Edge host, and use it to deploy an
Edge cluster.

Palette Edge enables you to customize your Edge hosts with the desired OS, Kubernetes distribution, dependencies, and
user data configurations.

This tutorial has provided you with hands-on experience with Palette Edge using a single VM, eliminating the need for a
complex lab environment or separate physical devices. You can also use this setup to test and validate Edge
configurations before deploying them in production.
