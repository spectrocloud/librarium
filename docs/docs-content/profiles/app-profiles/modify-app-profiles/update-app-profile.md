You can update an app profile to change the configuration of one or more layers and add or remove layers. You can also update basic profile information such as the name, description, and tags.

App profile changes will generate an update notification on all the Apps that are created from the profile. Update notifications include information about all the changes applied to the profile since the initial creation or since the previous update. You can apply updates to Apps individually at any time.


## Prerequisites

- An existing app profile.


## Modify Basic Profile Information
