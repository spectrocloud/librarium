You create app profiles using services that are required for Palette [Virtual Clusters](../../devx/palette-virtual-clusters/palette-virtual-clusters.md) deployed in Palette Dev Engine (PDE) in *App Mode*. Use app profiles to ensure consistency across virtual clusters. For more information about PDE, check out the [Palette Dev Engine](../../devx/devx.md) reference. 

App profile layers can be services, Helm Charts, or custom manifests. Palette provides several out-of-the-box services. Check out the Palette Dev Engine [Services](../../devx/app-profile/services/services.md) documentation to learn more about available services.
