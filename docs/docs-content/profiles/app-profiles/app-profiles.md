You create app profiles using services that are required for Palette [Virtual Clusters](../../devx/palette-virtual-clusters/palette-virtual-clusters.md) deployed in Palette Dev Engine (PDE) *App Mode*. Use app profiles to ensure consistency across virtual clusters. For more information about PDE, check out the [Palette Dev Engine](../../devx/devx.md) reference. 

You create app profiles using Helm Charts, custom manifests, and out-of-the-box services such as databases, message queue systems, and object storage. Check out the Palette Dev Engine [Services](../../devx/app-profile/services/services.md) documentation to learn more about available services.
