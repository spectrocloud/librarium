App profiles are templates you create with preconfigured services that are required for Palette [Virtual Cluster](../../devx/palette-virtual-clusters/palette-virtual-clusters.md) deployment. App profiles provide a way to drive consistency across virtual clusters deployed in the Palette Dev Engine (PDE) environment. 

You create app profiles in PDE *App Mode*, which is optimized for a streamlined developer experience that leverages Spectro Cloud's managed Kubernetes cluster. Access *App Mode* from the **User Menu**. For more information about PDE and *App Mode*, check out the [Palette Dev Engine](../../devx/devx.md) documentation.

You create app profiles to meet specific types of workloads on your virtual clusters. You can use containers, Helm charts, custom manifest, and out-of-the-box services such as databases, message queue systems, and object storage. Check out the Palette Dev Engine [Services](../../devx/services/services.md) documentation to learn more about the available services. 

You can also review all the Palette Dev Engine services that offer an out-of-the-box experience by reviewing the [Service Listings](../../devx/services/service-listings/service-listings.mdx).
