Create app profiles by configuring layers of preconfigured services, such as containers, Helm charts, custom manifests, and other out-of-the-box services for your Palette Virtual Cluster deployments.

You can create as many app profiles as needed for your Palette [Virtual Clusters](../../../devx/palette-virtual-clusters/palette-virtual-clusters.md). Each app profile can contain multiple services, which are layers in the app profile stack. You can also create multiple versions of an app profile. For more information about versioning, review [Version an App Profile](../modify-app-profiles/version-app-profile.md). 

The next sections guide you in creating a standard app profile, creating an app profile for container deployment, and creating an app profile using Helm Charts and manifests.
