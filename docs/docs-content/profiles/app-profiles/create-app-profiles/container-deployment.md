Palette App Mode supports the use of containers, a standard unit of software that packages code and all its dependencies to run applications quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. Containers contain all the required executables, binary codes, libraries, and configuration files. As a result, containers are lightweight and portable with less overhead. To add a container layer to a Palette Dev Engine app profile, follow the steps below. 


## Prerequisite

* Access to Palette Dev Engine App Mode.


## Add Container to App Profile

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com).


2. Select **App Profiles** from the left **Main Menu** and click on the **New App Profile** button at the top right-hand side of the main screen. 


3. Provide the wizard with the following information and click on **Next** after you have filled out the following basic information.

  |         Parameter           | Description  |
  |-------------------------------|-----------------|
  |**Application Profile Name** | A custom name for the App Profile|
  |**Description (optional)**   | Description of the App Profile, if any | 
  |**Tag (optional)**               | Tags on a cluster group are propagated to the infrastructure environment environments.|


4. Next, select **Container Deployment** from the available services list.


5. Provide the following information to the wizard.

  **General Settings**:

  | Parameter        | Description                                                                                            |
  | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | **Container Name**  | A unique name for the container deployment.                                                            |
  | **Registry**       | Select the registry from which the image will be downloaded. If specifying a non-Docker Hub registry, ensure you provide the full URL of the image. |
  | **Image**           | Image of the container to be deployed.                                                                 |
  | **Replicas** | The number of application instances to be deployed. This option follows the same behavior as a [*ReplicaSet*](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/) in the Kubernetes configuration file. A max of 10 replicas is supported.

  :::info

   
    
  When adding a container image from a public [DockerHub registry](https://hub.docker.com/), you can skip the registry hostname. For instance, to download the Nginx image, specify `nginx` and it will be downloaded correctly during the provisioning process.

6. Click the **Review** button when you have filled out the information and are ready to conclude the wizard. 

Once the container is added as a layer to the App Profile, continue with the remaining steps of the [App Profile creation](/devx/app-profile/create-app-profile) wizard. You can add more services as layers if needed.

## Validate

1. Login to [Palette](/devx#quickstartwithpaletteappmode).


2. Select the **App Profiles** option from the left **Main Menu**.   


3. In the App Profiles page, you will find your App Profile listed. Click the name of the App Profile to view the profile details. The app profile tier details will show the container added to the profile.
