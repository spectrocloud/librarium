Use the following steps to create an app profile that contains an out-of-the-box service such as messaging system,
object storage, database, and security services. Review the
[Out-of-the-Box Service](/devx/services/service-listings/service-listings.mdx) listing for available services.

:::info

A tutorial is available to help you learn how to use Palette Dev Engine by deploying an application. Check out
[Deploy an Application using Palette Dev Engine](../../../tutorials/cluster-deployment/pde/deploy-app.md) to get started
with Palette Dev Engine.

## Prerequisites

- A Spectro Cloud [account](https://www.spectrocloud.com/get-started/).

## Add an Out-of-the-Box Service to an App Profile

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com).

2. From the **User Menu**, select **Switch to App Mode**.

3. Select **App Profiles** in the left **Main Menu**, and click on the **New App Profile** button.

4. Provide the following basic information for your app profile and click **Next**.

   | **Parameter**        | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                           |
   | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **App Profile Name** | A custom name for the app profile.                                                                                                                                                                        |
   | **Version**          | An optional version number for the new app profile. You only need to specify a version if you create multiple versions of a profile using the same profile name. Default: `1.0.0`.                        |
   | **Description**      | Use the description to provide context about the profile.                                                                                                                                                 |
   | **Tag**              | Assign any desired profile tags. Tags propagate to the Virtual Machines (VMs) deployed in the cloud or data center environment when apps are created from this app profile. Example: `owner` or `region`. |

   To learn how to create multiple profile versions that use the same name, check out
   [Version a Cluster Profile](../modify-app-profiles/version-app-profile.md).

5. Select one of the out-of-the-box services to start configuring your app profile. Review the
   [Out-of-the-Box Service](/devx/services/service-listings/service-listings.mdx) listing to learn more about specific
   offerings.

6. Provide configuration information for the service.

7. You can add more services to the app profile as needed. To do this, click `+` next to the **Configure tier** pane. To
   rearrange layers in the profile, select a service and drag it up or down in the pane. Each service becomes a layer in
   the profile stack in the order displayed in this pane.

8. When you have provided the required configuration information for services, click **Review**.

Your app profile is now created using an out-of-the-box service and is ready to deploy.

## Validate

Use the following steps to validate that your app profile is available and ready for use.

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com).

2. From the **User Menu**, select **Switch to App Mode**.

3. Click on **App Profiles** in the left **Main Menu**, and select the app profile you created to review its details.

4. Hover your cursor over each profile layer to learn more about them, including the service name, version, and
   registry.

   :::info

   Use the tool-tip that displays when you select a layer to gather information required for creating Terraform
   templates for app profiles. Check out our Terraform registry for
   [Application Profiles](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs/resources/application_profile).

5. Deploy your application to a virtual cluster to verify all the required configurations and dependencies are correct.
   Review [Create and Manage Apps](../../../devx/apps/create-app.md) to learn how to deploy an app to a virtual cluster.
   Check out the
   [Deploy an Application using Palette Dev Engine](../../../tutorials/cluster-deployment/pde/deploy-app.md) tutorial
   for a more in-depth guide.

## Next Steps

Start exploring the various out-of-the-box [services](../../../devx/services/services.md) Palette exposes to application
authors. Use these services to deploy applications without the overhead of managing and configuring the infrastructure
required for common third-party services such as databases, message queues, and more.
