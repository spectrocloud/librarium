You can extend the list of available Palette Dev Engine services with custom Helm charts. Use the following steps to
create an app profile that contains a Helm chart.

:::info

A tutorial is available to help you learn how to use Palette Dev Engine by deploying an application. Check out
[Deploy an Application using Palette Dev Engine](../../../devx/apps/deploy-app.md) to get started with Palette Dev
Engine.

:::

## Prerequisites

- A Spectro Cloud [account](https://www.spectrocloud.com/get-started/).

## Add a Helm Chart to an App Profile

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com).

2. From the **User Menu**, select **Switch to App Mode**.

3. Select **App Profiles** from the left **Main Menu**, and click on the **New App Profile** button.

4. Provide the following basic information for your app profile and click **Next**.

| **Parameter**        | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **App Profile Name** | A custom name for the app profile.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Version**          | An optional version number for the new app profile. You only need to specify a version if you create multiple versions of a profile using the same profile name. Default: `1.0.0`.                        |
| **Description**      | Use the description to provide context about the profile.                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Tag**              | Assign any desired profile tags. Tags propagate to the Virtual Machines (VMs) deployed in the cloud or data center environment when apps are created from this app profile. Example: `owner` or `region`. |

To learn how to create multiple profile versions that use the same name, check out
[Version an App Profile](../modify-app-profiles/version-app-profile.md).

5. Select **Helm** to start configuring your app profile.

6. Use the **drop-down Menus** to select a Helm registry, chart, and version.

<!-- 8. Select a registry from the **drop-down Menu**.

8. Select a Helm chart from the **drop-down Menu**. The name of the chart you select displays as the chart name in the **Configure tier** panel.

9. Select the Helm version from the **drop-down Menu**. -->

7. You can add manifests to the app profile. To do this, click on **Add Manifests** and provide the manifest name.

:::warning

When adding a manifest-type layer to an app profile, make sure you specify a namespace. Otherwise, the manifest
deployment will be deployed to the `Default` namespace.

```yaml
namespace: yourNamespaceNameHere
```

:::

8. You can add services to the app profile as needed. To do this, click `+` next to the **Configure tier** pane. To
   rearrange layers in the profile, select a service and drag it up or down in the pane. Each service becomes a layer in
   the profile stack in the order displayed in this pane.

9. When you have provided the required configuration information, click **Review**.

Your app profile is now created using a Helm chart and can be deployed.

## Validate

Use the following steps to validate that your app profile is available and ready for use.

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com).

2. From the **User Menu**, switch to **App Mode**.

3. Click on **App Profiles** in the left **Main Menu**, and select the app profile you created to review its details.

4. Hover your cursor over each profile layer to learn more about them, including the service name, version, and
   registry.

:::info

Use the tool-tip that displays when you select a layer to gather information required for creating Terraform templates
for app profiles. Check out our Terraform registry for
[Application Profiles](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs/resources/application_profile).

:::

5. Deploy your application to a virtual cluster to verify all the required configurations and dependencies are correct.
   Review [Create and Manage Apps](../../../devx/apps/create-app.md) to learn how to deploy an app to a virtual cluster.
   Check out the [Deploy an Application using Palette Dev Engine](../../../devx/apps/deploy-app.md) tutorial for a more
   in-depth guide.

## Next Steps

Start exploring the various [services](../../../devx/services/services.md) Palette exposes to application authors. Use
these services to deploy applications without the overhead of managing and configuring the infrastructure required for
common third-party services such as databases, message queues, and more.
