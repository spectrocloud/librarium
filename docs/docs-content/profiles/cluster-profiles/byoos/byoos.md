Palette allows the flexibility to bring your own Operating System (OS) to use with your Kubernetes clusters. Use the **Bring Your Own OS (BYO-OS)** pack to upload your own OS images, configure drivers, and customize the OS to meet your specific requirements. This feature is especially useful for organizations with strict requirements around security, compliance, or specific hardware configurations.

The ability to bring your own OS to Palette gives you more control over dependencies in your environment and ensures compatibility with your existing applications. The OS you bring can be commercial or an open-source distribution.
