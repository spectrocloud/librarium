Add-on cluster profiles offer a range of benefits for workload cluster deployments. These profiles provide enhanced functionality by allowing the addition of various layers such as system apps, authentication, security, monitoring, logging, ingress, and load balancers to the cluster. 

This capability allows you to customize and configure clusters based on specific requirements. Add-on cluster profiles follow a modular approach, making managing and maintaining cluster configurations more flexible. Add-on profiles also promote reusability by allowing profiles to be used across multiple environments, projects, and tenants. Additionally, add-on profiles support integration-specific packs, charts, and manifests, providing flexibility and customization options for workload cluster deployments.

The next sections provide guidance in creating each type of these add-on profiles.
