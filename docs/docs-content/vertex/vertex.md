Palette VerteX offers regulated industries, such as government and public sector organizations that handle sensitive and
classified information simplicity, security, and scale in production Kubernetes. VerteX is available as a self-hosted
platform offering that you can install in your data centers or public cloud providers to manage Kubernetes clusters.

## FIPS-Compliant

Palette VerteX integrates validated Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 cryptographic modules in
Kubernetes clusters it deploys to ensure robust data protection for your organization’s infrastructure and applications.

To learn more about our FIPS 140-3 certification, review
[Spectro Cloud Cryptographic Module](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/5061).
FIPS modules, which are accessible in our private artifact repository, extend Palette’s existing security features that
include security scans, powerful RBAC, and tamper-proof edge device images. Palette VerteX protects sensitive data in
clusters across edge, bare metal, on-prem data centers, air-gapped environments, and cloud.
