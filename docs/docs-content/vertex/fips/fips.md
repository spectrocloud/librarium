Palette VerteX is FIPS 140-2 compliant. This means that Palette VerteX uses FIPS 140-2 compliant algorithms and encryption methods. With its additional security scanning capabilities, Palette VerteX is designed to meet the stringent requirements of regulated industries. Palette VerteX operates on FIPS-compliant Ubuntu Pro versions.


## Non-FIPS Enablement

You can deploy non-FIPS-compliant components in your Palette VerteX environment by enabling non-FIPS settings. Refer to the [Enable non-FIPS Settings](../system-management/enable-non-fips-settings/enable-non-fips-settings.md) guide for more information.


Something to note when using RKE2 and K3s:

<br />


- When we scan the binaries, which we consume directly from Rancher's RKE2 repository, issues are reported for the following components. These components were compiled with a Go compiler that is not FIPS-compliant.

  - container-suseconnect
  - container-suseconnect-zypp
  - susecloud

  <br />
  
  Since these components are unrelated to Kubernetes and are instead used to access SUSEâ€™s repositories during the Docker build process, RKE2 itself remains fully compliant. 
  
  RKE2 is designated as FIPS-compliant per official Rancher [FIPS 140-2 Enablement](https://docs.rke2.io/security/fips_support) security documentation. Therefore, Palette VerteX designates RKE2 as FIPS-compliant.
  


- Although K3s is not available as a FIPS-certified distribution, Palette VerteX supports K3s as a Kubernetes distribution for Edge clusters.

Palette VerteX uses icons to show FIPS compliance status. For information about Palette VerteX status icons, review [FIPS Status Icons](fips-status-icons.md).
