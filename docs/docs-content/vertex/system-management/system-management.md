Palette VerteX contains many system settings you can configure to meet your organization's needs. These settings are available at the system level and are applied to all [tenants](../../glossary-all.md#tenant) in the system. 

You can access the system setting by visiting the IP address or the custom domain name assigned to your Palette VerteX cluster and appending the `/system` path to the URL. For example, if your Palette VerteX cluster is hosted at `https://vertex.abc.com`, you can access the system settings at `https://vertex.abc.com/system`.

Exercise caution when changing system settings as the changes will be applied to all tenants in the system.
