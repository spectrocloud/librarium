Use the following steps to change the email address of the admin user.

## Prerequisites

- A Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server must be configured in the system console. Refer to
  [Configure SMTP](../smtp.md) page for guidance on how to configure an SMTP server.

## Change Email Address

   [Access the System Console](../system-management.md#access-the-system-console) guide.

2. From the **left Main Menu** select **My Account**.

3. Type the new email address in the **Email** field.

4. Provide the current password in the **Current Password** field.

5. Click **Apply** to save the changes.

## Validate

1. Log out of the system console. You can log out by clicking the **Logout** button in the bottom right corner of the
   **left Main Menu**.

2. Log in to the system console. Refer to [Access the System Console](../system-management.md#access-the-system-console)
   guide.
