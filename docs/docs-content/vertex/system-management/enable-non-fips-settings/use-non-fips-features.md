You can allow tenant users access to Palette features that are _not_ FIPS-compliant, such as tenant cluster backup and
restore or various scanning capabilities for compliance, security, validation, and software bill of materials (SBOM).
Prior to enabling non-FIPS features, the **Scan** and **Backups** tabs are not displayed on the **Cluster Overview**
page.

## Prerequisites

- You need tenant admin permission to enable this feature.

- Palette can back up clusters to several locations. To learn about backup requirements, review
  [Backup-Restore](../../../clusters/cluster-management/backup-restore/backup-restore.md).

- There are no prerequisites for restoring clusters or performing scans.

## Allow non-FIPS Features

1. Log in to [Palette VerteX](https://console.spectrocloud.com/) as a tenant admin.

2. Navigate to the left **Main Menu** and click on **Tenant Settings**.

3. On the **Tenant Settings Menu**, select **Platform Settings**.

4. Enable the **Allow non-FIPS features** option. When you enable this option, you are prompted to confirm the use of
   non-FIPS features for the tenant.

To disable the setting, toggle this option off and confirm you want to disable it.

## Validate

1. Log in to [Palette VerteX](https://console.spectrocloud.com/).

2. Navigate to the left **Main Menu** and click on **Clusters**.

3. Select your cluster in the list. The **Scan** and **Backups** tabs are now displayed on the **Cluster Overview**
   page.
