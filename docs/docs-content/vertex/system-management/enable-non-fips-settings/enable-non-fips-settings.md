Palette VerteX is FIPS-enforced by default, incorporating the Spectro Cloud Cryptographic Module into the Kubernetes Management Platform and the infrastructure components of target clusters. To learn more about our cryptographic library, check out [FIPS 140-2 Certification](../../../compliance.md#fips-140-2).

If desired, you can allow the consumption of certain non-FIPS functionality in Palette VerteX at the tenant level. **Platform Settings** at the tenant level provide toggles to allow non-FIPS-compliant add-on packs and non-FIPS features such as scans, backup, and restore. You can also allow importing clusters created external to Palette.
