# Install Palette VerteX on VMware vSphere

You install Palette VerteX using the Palette Command Line Interface (CLI) that guides you for details to create a configuration file and a three-node enterprise cluster for high availability (HA). You can invoke the Palette CLI on any Linux x86-64 system with the Docker daemon installed and connectivity to the VMware vSphere environment where Palette VerteX will be deployed. 


## Prerequisites

- An AMD64 Linux environment with connectivity to the VMware vSphere environment. 



- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) or equivalent container runtime installed and available on the Linux host.



- Palette CLI installed and available. Refer to the Palette CLI [Install](/palette-cli/install-palette-cli#downloadandsetup) page for guidance.


- An Ubuntu Pro Subscription and token. Ubuntu Pro provides access to FIPS 140-2 certified cryptographic packages.


- Review required VMware vSphere environment [permissions](/vertex/install-palette-vertex/install-on-vmware/vmware-system-requirements).



- We recommended the following resources for Palette VerteX. Refer to the [Palette VerteX size guidelines](/vertex/install-palette-vertex#sizeguidelines) for additional sizing information.

    - 8 CPUs per VM.

    - 16 GB Memory per VM.

    - 100 GB Disk Space per VM.
    

- The following network ports must be accessible for Palette VerteX to operate successfully.

  - TCP/443: Inbound to and outbound from the Palette VerteX management cluster.

  - TCP/6443: Outbound traffic from the Palette VerteX management cluster to the deployed cluster's Kubernetes API server.


- Ensure you have an SSL certificate that matches the domain name you will assign to Palette VerteX. You will need this to enable HTTPS encryption for Palette VerteX. Reach out to your network administrator or security team to obtain the SSL certificate. You need the following files:

  - x509 SSL certificate file in base64 format.

  - x509 SSL certificate key file in base64 format.

  - x509 SSL certificate authority file in base64 format. This file is optional.


- Zone tagging is required for dynamic storage allocation across fault domains when provisioning workloads that require persistent storage. Refer to [Zone Tagging](/vertex/install-palette-vertex/install-on-vmware/vmware-system-requirements#zonetagging) for information.


- Assigned IP addresses for application workload services, such as Load Balancer services.


- Shared Storage between vSphere hosts.

:::info

Self-hosted Palette VerteX installations provide a system Private Cloud Gateway (PCG) out-of-the-box and typically do not require a separate, user-installed PCG. However, you can create additional PCGs as needed to support provisioning into remote data centers that do not have a direct incoming connection from the Palette console. To learn how to install a PCG on VMware, check out the [VMware](/clusters/data-center/vmware) guide.

  <br />


  The installation process stands up a [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster locally that will orchestrate the remainder of the installation. The installation takes some time.

  <br />

  Upon completion, the enterprise cluster configuration file named `ec.yaml` contains the information you provided, and its location is displayed in the terminal. Credentials and tokens are encrypted in the YAML file. 

  <br />

  ```bash hideClipboard
  ==== Enterprise Cluster config saved ====
  Location: :/home/spectro/.palette/ec/ec-20230706150945/ec.yaml
  ```

  <br />

  When the installation is complete, Enterprise Cluster Details that include a URL and default credentials are displayed in the terminal. You will use these to access the Palette VerteX System Console.

  <br />

  ```bash hideClipboard
  ====================================
  ==== Enterprise Cluster Details ====
  ====================================
  Console URL: https://10.10.189.100/system
  Username: **********
  Password: **********
  ```


14. Copy the URL to the browser to access the System Console. You will be prompted to reset the password.

  <br />

  :::info

  The first time you visit the Palette VerteX system console, a warning message about an untrusted SSL certificate may appear. This is expected, as you have not yet uploaded your SSL certificate to Palette VerteX. You can ignore this warning message and proceed.

  ::: 

  <br />

  ![Screenshot of the Palette VerteX system console showing Username and Password fields.](/vertex_installation_install-on-vmware_vertex-system-console.png)

<br />


15. Log in to the System Console using the credentials provided in the Enterprise Cluster Details output. After login, you will be prompted to create a new password. Enter a new password and save your changes. You will be redirected to the Palette VerteX system console.
  

16. After login, a Summary page is displayed. Palette VerteX is installed with a self-signed SSL certificate. To assign a different SSL certificate you must upload the SSL certificate, SSL certificate key, and SSL certificate authority files to Palette VerteX. You can upload the files using the Palette VerteX system console. Refer to the [Configure HTTPS Encryption](/vertex/system-management/ssl-certificate-management) page for instructions on how to upload the SSL certificate files to Palette VerteX.


17. The last step is to start setting up a tenant. To learn how to create a tenant, check out the [Tenant Management](/vertex/system-management/tenant-management) guide. 

  <br />

  ![Screenshot of the Summary page showing where to click Go to Tenant Management button.](/vertex_installation_install-on-vmware_goto-tenant-management.png)


## Validate

You can verify the installation is successful if you can access the system console using the IP address provided in Enterprise Cluster Details and if the Summary page displays the **Go to Tenant Management** button.

You can also validate that a three-node Kubernetes cluster is launched and Palette VerteX is deployed on it.

<br />

1. Log in to the vCenter Server by using vSphere Client.


2. Navigate to the Datacenter and locate your VM instance. 


3. Select the VM to access its details page, and verify three nodes are listed.


4. Open a web browser session, and use the IP address provided in Enterprise Cluster Details at the completion of the installation to connect to the Palette VerteX System Console. Copy the IP address to the address bar and append `/system`.


5. Log in using your credentials.


6. A **Summary** page will be displayed that contains a tile with a **Go to Tenant Management** button. After initial installation, the **Summary** page shows there are zero tenants.
 

## Next Steps

You have successfully installed Palette VerteX in vSphere. Your next steps are to configure Palette VerteX for your organization. Start by creating the first tenant to host your users. Refer to [Create a Tenant](/vertex/system-management/tenant-management) for instructions. 

After you create the tenant, you are ready to configure authentication types in tenant settings and create users and teams.
