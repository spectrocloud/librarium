You install Palette VerteX in an airgap environment through the Palette Command Line Interface (CLI). The CLI provides
you with an interactive experience that guides you through the installation process. You can invoke the Palette CLI on
any Linux x86-64 system with the Docker daemon installed and connectivity to the VMware vSphere environment where
Palette VerteX will be deployed.

## Prerequisites

:::warning

If you are installing Palette VerteX in an airgap environment, ensure you complete all the airgap pre-install steps
before proceeding with the installation. Refer to the
[VMware vSphere Airgap Instructions](./vmware-vsphere-airgap-instructions.md) guide for more information.

:::

- An AMD64 Linux environment with connectivity to the VMware vSphere environment.

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) or equivalent container runtime installed and available on the Linux
  host.

- Palette CLI installed and available. Refer to the Palette CLI
  [Install](../../../../automation/palette-cli/install-palette-cli.md#download-and-setup) page for guidance.

- You can choose between two Operating Systems (OS) when installing Vertex. Review the requirements for each OS.

  - [Ubuntu Pro](https://ubuntu.com/pro) - you need an Ubuntu Pro subscription token.

  - [Red Hat Linux Enterprise](https://www.redhat.com/en) - you need a Red Hat subscription and a custom RHEL vSphere
    template with Kubernetes available in your vSphere environment. To learn how to create the required template, refer
    to the [RHEL and PXK](../../../../byoos/image-builder/build-image-vmware/rhel-pxk.md) guide.

    :::warning

    Do not proceed with the installation until you have the met the OS requirements.

    :::

- Review the required VMware vSphere [permissions](../vmware-system-requirements.md). Ensure you have created the proper
  custom roles and zone tags.

- We recommended the following resources for Palette VerteX. Refer to the
  [Palette VerteX size guidelines](../../install-palette-vertex.md#instance-sizing) for additional sizing information.

  - 8 CPUs per VM.

  - 16 GB Memory per VM.

  - 100 GB Disk Space per VM.

- The following network ports must be accessible for Palette VerteX to operate successfully.

  - TCP/443: Inbound to and outbound from the Palette VerteX management cluster.

  - TCP/6443: Outbound traffic from the Palette VerteX management cluster to the deployed cluster's Kubernetes API
    server.

- The network IP address range you specify during the installation must not overlap with any existing IP addresses in
  your environment. The IP address range must also have connectivity to the VMware vSphere environment.

- Ensure you have an SSL certificate that matches the domain name you will assign to Palette VerteX. You will need this
  to enable HTTPS encryption for Palette VerteX. Reach out to your network administrator or security team to obtain the
  SSL certificate. You need the following files:

  - x509 SSL certificate file in base64 format.

  - x509 SSL certificate key file in base64 format.

  - x509 SSL certificate authority file in base64 format. This file is optional.

- Zone tagging is required for dynamic storage allocation across fault domains when provisioning workloads that require
  persistent storage. Refer to [Zone Tagging](../vmware-system-requirements.md#zone-tagging) for information.

- Assigned IP addresses for application workload services, such as Load Balancer services.

- Shared Storage between VMware vSphere hosts.

:::info

Self-hosted Palette VerteX installations provide a system Private Cloud Gateway (PCG) out-of-the-box and typically do
not require a separate, user-installed PCG. However, you can create additional PCGs as needed to support provisioning
into remote data centers that do not have a direct incoming connection from the Palette console. To learn how to install
a PCG on VMware, check out the [Deploy to VMware vSphere](../../../../clusters/pcg/deploy-pcg/vmware.md) guide.

:::

:::warning

Palette VerteX does not support insecure connections. Ensure you have the Certificate Authority (CA) available, in PEM
format, when using a custom packs and image registry. Otherwise, VerteX will not be able to pull packs and images from
the registry. The Palette CLI will prompt you to provide the CA certificate file path when necessary.

:::

## Deployment

The video below demonstrates the installation wizard and the prompts you will encounter. Take a moment to watch the
video before you begin the installation process. Make sure to use values that are appropriate for your environment. Use
the **three-dots Menu** in the lower right corner of the video to expand the video to full screen and to change the
playback speed.

<Video title="palette-cli-install" src="/videos/vertex-airgap-install.mp4"></Video>

Use the following steps to install Palette VerteX.

1.  Log in to your vCenter environment.

2.  Create a vSphere VM and Template folder with the name `spectro-templates`. Ensure this folder is accessible by the
    user account you will use to deploy the airgap VerteX installation.

3.  Use the URL below to import the Operating System and Kubernetes distribution OVA required for the install. Place the
    OVA in the `spectro-templates` folder. Refer to the
    [Import Items to a Content Library](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-vm-administration/GUID-B413FBAE-8FCB-4598-A3C2-8B6DDA772D5C.html?hWord=N4IghgNiBcIJYFsAOB7ATgFwAQYKbIjDwGcQBfIA)
    guide for information about importing an OVA in vCenter.

    ```url
     https://vmwaregoldenimage-console.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/u-2204-0-k-12711-0.ova
    ```

4.  Append an `r_` prefix to the OVA name and remove the `.ova` suffix after the import. For example, the final output
    should look like `r_u-2204-0-k-12711-0`. This naming convention is required for the install process to identify the
    OVA. Refer to the [Supplement Packs](../../airgap/supplemental-packs.md#additional-ovas) page for a list of
    additional OVAs you can download and upload to your vCenter environment.

    :::tip

    You can also use the **Deploy OVF Template** wizard in vSphere to make the OVA available in the `spectro-templates`
    folder. Append the `r_` prefix, and remove the `.ova` suffix when assigning a name and target location. You can
    terminate the deployment after the OVA is available in the `spectro-templates` folder. Refer to the
    [Deploy an OVF or OVA Template](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-vm-administration/GUID-AFEDC48B-C96F-4088-9C1F-4F0A30E965DE.html)
    guide for more information about deploying an OVA in vCenter.

    :::

5.  Open a terminal window and invoke the Palette CLI by using the `ec` command to install the enterprise cluster. The
    interactive CLI prompts you for configuration details and then initiates the installation. For more information
    about the `ec` subcommand, refer to [Palette Commands](../../../../automation/palette-cli/commands/ec.md).

        ```bash
        palette ec install
        ```

6.  At the **Enterprise Cluster Type** prompt, choose **Palette VerteX**.

Otherwise, type `n`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
    | **Use Public Registry for Images**               | Type `y` to use a public registry for images. Type `n` to a different registry for images. If you are using another registry for images, you will be prompted to enter the registry URL, base path, username, and password. Airgap users, select `n` so that you can specify the values for the OCI registry that contains all the required images. |

    When prompted to **Pull images from public registry**, type `n` and specify the OCI registry configuration values
    for your image registry. If you are an [airgap support VM](./vmware-vsphere-airgap-instructions.md), the CLI will
    automatically detect the airgap environment and prompt you to **Use local, air-gapped Image Registry?**. Type `y` to
    use the local resources and skip filling in the OCI registry URL and credentials. Refer to the table above for more
    information.

16. Specify the IP pool configuration. The placement type can be Static or Dynamic Domain Name Server (DDNS). Choosing
    static placement creates an IP pool from which VMs are assigned IP addresses. Choosing DDNS assigns IP addresses
    using DNS.

        #### Static Placement Configuration

        | **Parameter**                   | **Description**                                                                             |
        | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
        | **IP Start range**              | Enter the first address in the EC IP pool range.                                            |
        | **IP End range**                | Enter the last address in the EC IP pool range.                                             |
        | **Network Prefix**              | Enter the network prefix for the IP pool range. Valid values are in [0, 32]. Example: `18`. |
        | **Gateway IP Address**          | Enter the IP address of the static IP gateway.                                              |

        | **Name server search suffixes** | An optional comma-separated list of DNS search domains.                                     |

17. The last set of prompts are for the vSphere machine and database configuration. Use the following table for
    guidance.

        #### vSphere Machine Configuration

        | **Parameter** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                             |
        | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
        | **Small**     | Deploy VM nodes with 8 CPU, 16 GB memory, 60 GB storage. The database specs are 20 GB database with 2 CPU limit and 4 GB memory limit.                                      |
        | **Medium**    | Deploy VM nodes with 16 CPU, 32 GB memory, 100 GB storage. The database specs are 60 GB database with 4 CPU limit and 8 GB memory limit.                                    |
        | **Large**     | Deploy VM nodes with 32 CPU, 64 GB memory, 120 GB storage. The database specs are 80 GB database with 8 CPU limit and 16 GB memory limit.                                   |
        | **Custom**    | Deploy VM nodes with custom CPU, memory, storage, database size, CPU limit, and memory limit. If you specify custom, you will be prompted for the CPU, memory, and storage. |

        #### Additional vSphere Machine Configuration

        | **Parameter**     | **Description**                                                                          |
        | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
        | **Node Affinity** | Select the node affinity. Enter `y` to schedule all Palette pods on control plane nodes. |

    The installation process stands up a [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster locally that will orchestrate the
    remainder of the installation. The installation takes some time.

    Upon completion, the enterprise cluster configuration file named `ec.yaml` contains the information you provided,
    and its location is displayed in the terminal. Credentials and tokens are encrypted in the YAML file.

    ```bash hideClipboard
    ==== Enterprise Cluster config saved ====
    Location: :/home/spectro/.palette/ec/ec-20230706150945/ec.yaml
    ```

    :::tip

    If an error occurs during installation, remove the `kind` cluster that was created and restart the installation. To
    remove the `kind` cluster, issue the following command. Replace `spectro-mgmt-cluster` with the name of your cluster
    if you used a different name.

    ```bash
    kind delete cluster spectro-mgmt-cluster
    ```

    Restart the install process by referencing the `ec.yaml` file that was created during the first installation
    attempt. For example:

    ```bash
    palette ec install --config /home/spectro/.palette/ec/ec-20230706150945/ec.yaml
    ```

    :::

    When the installation is complete, Enterprise Cluster Details that include a URL and default credentials are
    displayed in the terminal. You will use these to access the Palette VerteX System Console. The Palette CLI has the
    kubectl CLI included. You can find the kubectl binary in the **bin** directory of the Palette CLI configuration
    directory, located at **~/.palette/bin/kubectl**.

    ```bash hideClipboard
    ===========================================
    ==== Enterprise Cluster System Console ====
    ===========================================
    Console URL: https://10.10.100.0/system
    Username:    ************
    Password:    ************

    The first of three Enterprise Cluster nodes is online and will now provision nodes two and three.

    It will take another ~30-45 minutes for the installation to complete.

    You can monitor its progress via kubectl/k9s or by viewing the system console.

    export KUBECONFIG=/ubuntu/.palette/ec/ec-20231012215923/spectro_mgmt.conf
    ```

18. To avoid potential vulnerabilities, once the installation is complete, remove the `kind` images that were installed
    in the environment where you initiated the installation.

    Issue the following command to list all instances of `kind` that exist in the environment.

    ```shell
    docker images
    ```

    ```shell
    REPOSITORY     TAG        IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
    kindest/node   v1.26.13   131ad18222cc   5 months ago   910MB
    ```

    Then, use the following command template to remove all instances of `kind`.

    ```shell
    docker image rm kindest/node:<version>
    ```

    Consider the following example for reference.

    ```shell
    docker image rm kindest/node:v1.26.13
    ```

    ```shell
    Untagged: kindest/node:v1.26.13
    Untagged: kindest/node@sha256:15ae92d507b7d4aec6e8920d358fc63d3b980493db191d7327541fbaaed1f789
    Deleted: sha256:131ad18222ccb05561b73e86bb09ac3cd6475bb6c36a7f14501067cba2eec785
    Deleted: sha256:85a1a4dfc468cfeca99e359b74231e47aedb007a206d0e2cae2f8290e7290cfd
    ```

19. Log in to the system console using the credentials provided in the Enterprise Cluster Details output. After login,
    you will be prompted to create a new password. Enter a new password and save your changes. Refer to the
    [password requirements](../../../system-management/account-management/credentials.md#password-requirements-and-security)
    documentation page to learn more about the password requirements.

    Use the username `admin` and your new password to log in to the system console. You can create additional system
    administrator accounts and assign roles to users in the system console. Refer to the
    [Account Management](../../../system-management/account-management/account-management.md) documentation page for
    more information.

    :::info

    The first time you visit the VerteX system console, a warning message about an untrusted SSL certificate may appear.
    This is expected, as you have not yet uploaded your SSL certificate to Palette. You can ignore this warning message
    and proceed.

    :::

    ![Screenshot of the Palette VerteX system console showing Username and Password fields.](/vertex_installation_install-on-vmware_vertex-system-console.webp)

20. After login, a Summary page is displayed. Palette VerteX is installed with a self-signed SSL certificate. To assign
    a different SSL certificate you must upload the SSL certificate, SSL certificate key, and SSL certificate authority
    files to Palette VerteX. You can upload the files using the Palette VerteX system console. Refer to the
    [Configure HTTPS Encryption](/vertex/system-management/ssl-certificate-management) page for instructions on how to
    upload the SSL certificate files to Palette VerteX.

21. The last step is to start setting up a tenant. To learn how to create a tenant, check out the
    [Tenant Management](../../../system-management/tenant-management.md) guide.

    ![Screenshot of the Summary page showing where to click Go to Tenant Management button.](/vertex_installation_install-on-vmware_goto-tenant-management.webp)

## Validate

You can verify the installation is successful if you can access the system console using the IP address provided in
Enterprise Cluster Details and if the Summary page displays the **Go to Tenant Management** button.

You can also validate that a three-node Kubernetes cluster is launched and Palette VerteX is deployed on it.

1. Log in to the vCenter Server by using vSphere Client.

2. Navigate to your vSphere Datacenter and locate your Palette VM instances. The VMs are prefixed with the name you
   provided during the installation. For example, if you provided `spectro-mgmt-cluster` as the name, the VMs are named
   `spectro-mgmt-cluster-`, followed by a unique set of alphanumeric values. Verify three nodes are available.

3. Open a web browser session, and use the IP address provided in Enterprise Cluster Details at the completion of the
   installation to connect to the Palette system console. Copy the IP address to the address bar and append `/system`.

4. Log in using your credentials.

5. A **Summary** page will be displayed that contains a tile with a **Go to Tenant Management** button. After initial
   installation, the **Summary** page shows there are zero tenants.

## Next Steps

You have successfully installed Palette VerteX in vSphere. Your next steps are to configure Palette VerteX for your
organization. Start by creating the first tenant to host your users. Refer
to [Create a Tenant](../../../system-management/tenant-management.md) for instructions.

After you create the tenant, you are ready to configure authentication types in tenant settings and create users and
teams.
