This section helps you prepare your VMware vSphere airgap environment for VerteX installation. You can choose between
two methods to prepare your environment:

1. If you have a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) VM deployed in your environment, follow the
   [Environment Setup with an Existing RHEL VM](./env-setup-vm-vertex.md) guide to learn how to prepare this VM for
   VerteX installation.
2. If you do not have an RHEL VM, follow the [Environment Setup with OVA](./vmware-vsphere-airgap-instructions.md)
   guide. This guide will show you how to use an OVA to deploy an airgap support VM in your VMware vSphere environment,
   which will then assist with the VerteX installation process.
