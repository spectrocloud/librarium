Use the following checklist to ensure you have completed all the required steps before deploying the airgap Palette
installation.

- [ ] Create a vSphere VM and Template folder named `spectro-templates`.

- [ ] Import the Operating System and Kubernetes distribution OVA required for the installation and place the OVA in the
      `spectro-templates` folder.

- [ ] Append the `r_` prefix and remove the `.ova` suffix from the OVA name after the import.

- [ ] Start the airgap setup binary and verify the setup is completed successfully.

- [ ] Review the list of [pack binaries](../../airgap/supplemental-packs.md) to download and upload to your OCI
      registry.

- [ ] If you have custom SSL certificates you want to include, copy the custom SSL certificates, in base64 PEM format,
      to the support VM. The custom certificates must be placed in the **/opt/spectro/ssl** folder. Include the
      following files:
  - **server.crt**
  - **server.key**
