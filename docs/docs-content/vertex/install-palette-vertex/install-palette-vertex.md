Palette VerteX is available as a self-hosted application that you install in your environment. The self-hosted version is a dedicated Palette VerteX environment hosted on VMware instances or in an existing Kubernetes cluster. Palette VerteX is available in the following modes:

| **Supported Platform** | **Description**                    |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| VMware                 | Install Palette VerteX in VMware environment. |
| Kubernetes             | Install Palette VerteX using a Helm Chart in an existing Kubernetes cluster. |

The next sections describe specific requirements for installing Palette VerteX.

## Proxy Requirements

- A proxy used for outgoing connections should support both HTTP and HTTPS traffic.


- Allow connectivity to domains and ports in the table.

## Size Guidelines

This section lists resource requirements for Palette VerteX for various capacity levels. In Palette VerteX, the terms *small*, *medium*, and *large* are used to describe the instance size of worker pools that Palette VerteX is installed on. The following table lists the resource requirements for each size. 


<br />

:::caution

The recommended maximum number of deployed nodes and clusters in the environment should not be exceeded. We have tested the performance of Palette VerteX with the recommended maximum number of deployed nodes and clusters. Exceeding these limits can negatively impact performance and result in instability. The active workload limit refers to the maximum number of active nodes and pods at any given time.
