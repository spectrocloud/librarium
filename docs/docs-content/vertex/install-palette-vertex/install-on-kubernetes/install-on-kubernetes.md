Palette VerteX can be installed on Kubernetes with internet connectivity or an airgap environment. When you install
Palette VerteX, a three-node cluster is created. You use a Helm chart our support team provides to install Palette
VerteX on Kubernetes. Refer to [Access Palette VerteX](../../vertex.md#access-palette-vertex) for instructions on
requesting access to the Helm Chart.

To get started with Palette VerteX on Kubernetes, refer to the [Install Instructions](install.md) guide.
