application. You can use the following service types out of the box with minimal configuration.

  users. It allows people to send and receive messages in real time using different devices and communication channels.

  videos, and backups. It's managed as objects, not files or blocks, and is scalable and durable.

  used for applications and websites to store information such as user data, transactions, and analytics.
