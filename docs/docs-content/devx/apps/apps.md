Applications are the combination of an [App Profile](../../profiles/app-profiles/create-app-profiles/create-app-profiles.md)
   and a [Palette Virtual Cluster](../palette-virtual-clusters/palette-virtual-clusters.md). When you specify an application profile and deploy it to a virtual cluster, you create an application.
