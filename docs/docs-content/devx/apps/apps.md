Applications are the combination of an
[App Profile](../../profiles/app-profiles/create-app-profiles/create-app-profiles.md) and a
[Palette Virtual Cluster](../palette-virtual-clusters/palette-virtual-clusters.md). When you specify an application
profile and deploy it to a virtual cluster, you create an application.
