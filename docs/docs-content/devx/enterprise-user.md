You can use the Palette Developer Experience (PDE) to serve two common use cases: enterprise developers and individual
application authors who want to deploy a containerized application without worrying about infrastructure overhead.

Refer to the [Enterprise Users](#enterprise-users) section to learn more about enabling PDE for a large set of
downstream users. If you are an individual application author, check out the
[Individual Application Author](#application-authors) section to get started.

## Enterprise Users

To enable PDE for downstream users, start by reviewing the following resources.

1. Understand the difference between [Cluster Mode and App Mode](../introduction/palette-modes.md).

2. Create and Manage the [Cluster Group](../clusters/cluster-groups/cluster-groups.md).

3. Allocate [User Quota](manage-dev-engine/resource-quota.md).

The next set of references are not required but good for Palette administrators to be aware of.

- [Enable Disk Backup on Virtual Clusters](../clusters/cluster-groups/cluster-group-backups.md).

- [Set Up Ingress for a Cluster Group](../clusters/cluster-groups/ingress-cluster-group.md).

- [Pause and Resume Palette Virtual Clusters](palette-virtual-clusters/pause-restore-virtual-clusters.md).

- [Resize Palette Virtual Clusters](palette-virtual-clusters/resize-virtual-clusters.md).

## Application Authors

Use PDE to deploy your containerized applications to Palette. Leverage Palette's free-tier offering of PDE to get
started. Create your application profiles and deploy your applications to Palette in no time.

Use the following resource to get started with PDE today.

- [Tutorial](../tutorials/pde/deploy-app.md).

- Learn about [App Mode versus Cluster Mode](../introduction/palette-modes.md).

- Familiarize yourself with [App Profiles](../profiles/app-profiles/app-profiles.md).

- Review the supported [out-of-the-box-services](../devx/services/service-listings/service-listings.mdx).
