You can resize virtual clusters from the default size of 4 CPU, 4 GiB Memory, 2 GiB Storage to a size that does not exceed the system-level quota for a cluster group like Beehive or the user quota for tenant-level cluster groups. 

## Prerequisite

* An active and healthy [virtual cluster](/devx/palette-virtual-clusters/pause-restore-virtual-clusters).

## Resize Virtual Clusters


Use the following steps to resize a virtual cluster.


1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com).


2. In App Mode, click **Virtual Clusters** in the **Main Menu**.


3. Select the virtual cluster you want to resize, and click **Settings > Cluster Settings**.


4. Click **Cluster Size** and specify new resource allocations for your virtual cluster. The size you specify cannot be greater than the system-level quota for a cluster group like Beehive or the user quota for tenant-level cluster groups. To learn more about resource quotas, refer to the [resource quota](/devx/manage-dev-engine/resource-quota) documentation.


5. Save your changes.


## Validate

To verify your changes, click **Virtual Clusters** in the left **Main Menu** and select the resized cluster. The virtual cluster Overview page displays the new **Allocated Quota** for the cluster.
