## Additional OVAs

The following tables list additional OVAs you may need depending on the Kubernetes version and distribution you want to
use for the workload clusters.

<PartialsComponent category="vertex" name="airgap-additional-ovas" />

### Usage Instructions

Use the provided download URL to download the OVA and upload it to your vSphere environment. The OVA must be uploaded to
the `spectro-templates ` so VerteX can access it. One additional note about uploaded OVAs, the OVA name must be prefixed
with `r_` to be recognized by VerteX. You can rename the OVA before you upload it or after you upload it to vSphere.
