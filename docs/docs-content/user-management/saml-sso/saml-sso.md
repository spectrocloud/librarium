Palette supports Single Sign-On (SSO) with a variety of Identity Providers (IDP). You can enable SSO in Palette by using
the following protocols for authentication and authorization.

- Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) - SAML is a standalone protocol that requires a centralized identity
  provider (IDP) to manage user identities and credentials. SAML supports SSO and is commonly used for enterprise
  applications.

- OpenID Connect (OIDC) - OIDC more modern protocol designed for web and mobile applications. OIDC is built on top of
  [OAuth 2.0](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749), a widely used authorization framework. OIDC supports distributed
  identity providers and supports social login providers such as Google or GitHub.
