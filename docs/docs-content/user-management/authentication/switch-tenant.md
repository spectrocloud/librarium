You can switch between tenants in Palette to access resources and manage configurations in different tenants without
having to log in again. This feature is available to self-hosted Palette, VerteX, and Palette SaaS.

## Prerequisites

- You must have a user account in the tenant you want to switch to.

- At least two tenants must be available in the Palette instance. System administrators for self-hosted Palette or
  VerteX instances can create multiple tenants. Refer to the Palette
  [Tenant Management](../../enterprise-version/system-management/tenant-management.md) or the Vertex
  [Tenant Management](../../vertex/system-management/tenant-management.md) page for guidance on how to create tenants.
  Users of Palette SaaS, contact our support team at [support@spectrocloud.com](mailto:support@spectrocloud.com) for
  additional tenants.

access is limited to the permissions assigned to your user account in the tenant.
