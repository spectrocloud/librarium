You can switch between tenants in Palette to access resources and manage configurations in different tenants without
having to log in again. This feature is available to self-hosted Palette, VerteX, and Palette SaaS.

## Prerequisites

- You must have a user account in the tenant you want to switch to.

- At least two tenants must be available in the Palette instance. System administrators for self-hosted Palette or
  VerteX instances can create multiple tenants. Refer to the self-hosted Palette
  [Tenant Management](../../self-hosted-setup/palette/system-management/tenant-management.md) or the Palette VerteX
  [Tenant Management](<(../../self-hosted-setup/vertex/system-management/tenant-management.md)>) page for guidance on
  how to create tenants. Users of Palette SaaS, contact our support team at
  [support@spectrocloud.com](mailto:support@spectrocloud.com) for additional tenants.

## Switch Tenant

2. Click on the **drop-down Menu** at the top of the page.

4. Select the tenant you want to switch to from the list of available tenants.

You are now switched to the selected tenant and can access its resources and configurations. Keep in mind that your
access is limited to the permissions assigned to your user account in the tenant.
