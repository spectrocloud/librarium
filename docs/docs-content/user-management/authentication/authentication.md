Palette supports three types of user authentication methods. 

* User Interface UI authentication

* API Key

* Authorization Token

The API key and the authorization token method can be used when interacting with Palette REST APIs for automation and programmatic purposes.


## UI Authentication
<!-- vale off -->
You can log into Palette SaaS platform by visiting the console URL at [http://console.spectrocloud.com](https://console.spectrocloud.com). If you are a user of a self-hosted Palette or Palette VerteX, then you should use the URL provided by your system administrator, such as `palette.abc-company.com.` 

To learn more the UI authentication, refer to the [UI Authentication](./ui-autentication.md) section.

## API Key

You can use API keys to authenticate API requests. Use the API key to make REST API without having to provide your username and password. Check the [API Key](api-key/api-key.md) section for more information.

<!-- Key points to note about API Keys:

* Tenant admin can create an API Key for any user within the tenant.

* Once you create an API Key, you cannot view the key again. Save the key in a secure location, such as a password manager.

* Users can create API Keys for themselves. -->

<!-- ## Creating an API key as a tenant admin

* Login to Palette using credential with admin role.
* Go to Tenant Settings and select **API Keys**.
* Click on “Add New API Key” to create a new API key. The following information is required for creating a new API Key:
  * API Key Name: The tenant/user-specified custom name for the key.
  * Description: An optional description about the key.
  * Username: Select the user for whom the key is created from the drop-down.

### API Key Usage

You copy your API key from the Palette dashboard and use it for making REST API calls in one of the following ways:

* Query Parameter - Pass the key as a query parameter`ApiKey=<apiKey>`. Example:
  `v1/spectroclusters?ApiKey=QMOI1ZVKVIoW6LM6uXqSWFPsjmt0juvl`
* Request Header - Pass the API Key as a HTTP request header in the following format:
  * Key: ApiKey
  * Value: API key copied from the Palette Console. E.g.: QMOI1ZVKVIoW6LM6uXqSWFPsjmt0juvl -->

## Authorization Token

You can use authorization tokens to authenticate API requests.  To obtain an authorization token, use the `v1/auth/authenticate` API endpoint with a POST request to authenticate and obtain the authorization token. Provide your API key as a header value or query parameter. 

To learn more about the authorization token, refer to the [Authorization Token](authorization-token.md) section.
