You can log into Palette SaaS platform by visiting the console URL at
[https://console.spectrocloud.com](https://console.spectrocloud.com). If you are a user of a self-hosted Palette or
Palette VerteX, then you should use the URL provided by your system administrator, such as `palette.abc-company.com.`

The Palette UI authentication method is the default authentication method for Palette. You can use the UI to sign up for
a Palette account or sign in to an existing account. You can also use the UI to sign in to Palette using a third-party
identity provider, such as GitHub or Google.

## Account Sign Up

To sign up for a Palette account, ask you Palette tenant administrator to send you an invitation email. Check out the
[Create and Manage a User](../users-and-teams/create-user.md) guide for more information.

## Sign In Flow

If you created your user with a username and password, then you may be prompted to select the organization you wish to
log in to. If you are a member of a single organization, then you will not be prompted for an organization selection.

If you created an account through SSO and are a member of different organizations, then you must first select the
organization name you wish to log in to. Click on the **Sign in to your organization** button for the option to specify
the organization name. If you need help remembering the organization name, click on the **Forgot your organization
name?** button and provide your email address to receive an email containing your organization name and its login URL.

If you are a Palette Enterprise user, use the custom Palette URL for an optimized login experience and avoid specifying
the organization name. Ask your Palette system administrator for the custom Palette URL.
