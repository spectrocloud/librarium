Palette API keys can be used to authenticate requests to the Palette REST API calls. You can use the API key to make REST API calls without providing your username and password. If you are a tenant admin, you can create API keys for yourself or other users.

Tenant administrators have additional permissions and capabilities to manage API keys. Tenant admins can create, edit, revoke, and delete API keys for any user within the tenant. Each of these actions is described in detail in the following resources. Refer to the [Tenant Admin API Key Management](../../../tenant-settings/api-key-management.md) section for more information.
