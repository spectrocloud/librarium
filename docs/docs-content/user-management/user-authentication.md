Palette supports three types of user authentication methods. 

* [User Interface (UI)](#ui-authentication) authentication

* [API Key](#api-key)

* [Authorization Token](#authorization-token)

The API key and the authorization token method can be used when interacting with Palette REST APIs for automation and programmatic purposes.


## UI Authentication
<!-- vale off -->
You can log into Palette by visiting the Palette at [http://console.spectrocloud.com](https://console.spectrocloud.com). If you are a user of a Palette Enterprise instance, then you should use the URL provided by your Palette system 
administrator, such as `example-company.console.spectrocloud.com.` 
<!-- vale on -->
## Account Sign Up

You can sign up for a Palette SaaS account by visiting [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com) or an Enterprise Palette account under your organization by using your organization's custom Palette URL.

When you create an account, you can create a username and password or create the account through a third-party identity provider, GitHub, Google, or other OIDC providers that are enabled for your organization. For Palette SaaS, GitHub and Google are automatically enabled for SSO integration.

## Sign In Flow

Starting with Palette 3.2, the user sign-in flow can be different depending on how you created your Palette account. If you created your user with a username and password, then you may be prompted to select the organization you wish to log in to. If you are a member of a single organization, then you will not be prompted for an organization selection.

If you created an account through SSO and are a member of different organizations, then you must first select the organization name you wish to log in to. Click on the **Sign in to your organization** button for the option to specify the organization name. If you need help remembering the organization name, click on the **Forgot your organization name?** button and provide your email address to receive an email containing your organization name and its login URL.

If you are a Palette Enterprise user, use the custom Palette URL for an optimized login experience and avoid specifying the organization name. 
Ask your Palette system administrator for the custom Palette URL.

## API Key Usage

You copy your API key from the Palette dashboard and use it for making REST API calls in one of the following ways:

* Query Parameter - Pass the key as a query parameter`ApiKey=<apiKey>`. Example:
  `v1/spectroclusters?ApiKey=QMOI1ZVKVIoW6LM6uXqSWFPsjmt0juvl`
* Request Header - Pass the API Key as a HTTP request header in the following format:
  * Key: ApiKey
  * Value: API key copied from the Palette Console. E.g.: QMOI1ZVKVIoW6LM6uXqSWFPsjmt0juvl

## Authorization Token

You can use authorization tokens to authenticate requests. 

To obtain an authorization token, use the `v1/auth/authenticate` endpoint with a POST request to authenticate and obtain the authorization token. Provide your API key as a header value or query parameter. The authorization token is valid for 15 minutes. You can refresh the token using the refresh token API.

API requests using the authroization token must use the HTTP header `Authorization` with token as the value. For example:

```bash
TOKEN=abcd1234
```

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.spectrocloud.com/v1/projects/alert' \
--header 'Authorization: $TOKEN' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' 
```

To refresh the authorization token, use the `v1/auth/refresh` endpoint with a GET request to refresh the authorization token.
