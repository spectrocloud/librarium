## ISO 27001

![ISO 27001 logo](/legal-licenses_compliance_iso-27001.webp "#width=300px")

The International Organization for Standardization 27001 Standard (ISO 27001) is one of the leading international
standards focused on information security. Spectro Cloud has obtained the ISO 27001 Certification and undergoes periodic
audits to maintain this certification. ISO 27001 Certification provides assurances that Spectro Cloud is identifying and
managing risks effectively, consistently, and measurably.

Below are some reasons why an ISO 27001 Certification is important:

- Customer trust and confidence: Clients and partners often look for assurances that their sensitive information is
  handled securely. Achieving ISO 27001 certification can enhance customer trust and confidence, potentially leading to
  increased business opportunities.

- Risk Management: By implementing ISO controls and measures, companies can mitigate these risks, protecting sensitive
  data from unauthorized access or disclosure.

- Legal and regulatory compliance: Adhering to ISO 27001 demonstrates a commitment to information security, which can
  help organizations comply with various legal and regulatory requirements related to data protection and privacy.

- Global recognition: ISO 27001 is globally recognized. This helps organizations communicate their commitment to
  information security across borders.

## SOC 2 Type II

The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Service Organization Controls (SOC) Attestation provides
assurances over control environments. Spectro Cloud’s SOC 2 Type II audit report provides assurances of our
organization’s security and availability.

- SOC 2 audits are an important component in regulatory oversight, vendor management programs, internal governance, and
  risk management.

- These reports help our users and their auditors understand the controls established at Spectro Cloud to support
  operations and compliance.

- Spectro Cloud’s SOC 2 Type II report is available upon request for any customers or prospects with a signed
  non-disclosure agreement in place.

## FIPS 140-3

Spectro Cloud is validated against FIPS 140-3 with
[Certificate number 5061](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/5061) in
compliance with the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP).

Our Spectro Cloud Cryptographic Module is a general-purpose cryptographic library. The FIPS-enforced Palette VerteX
edition incorporates the module in the Kubernetes Management Platform and the infrastructure components of target
clusters to protect the sensitive information of regulated industries. Palette VerteX supports FIPS at the tenant level.
For more information about the FIPS-enforced Palette edition, check out [Palette VerteX](vertex/vertex.md).

The module is tested against these configurations:

- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 on Dell PowerEdge R440 with Intel Xeon Silver 4214R _with and without_ PAA
- SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 on Dell PowerEdge R450 with Intel Xeon Silver 4309Y _with and without_ PAA
- Ubuntu 18.04 on Dell PowerEdge R450 with Intel Xeon Silver 4309Y _with and without_ PAA
- Ubuntu 20.04 on Dell PowerEdge R450 with Intel Xeon Silver 4309Y _with and without_ PAA

## Joint Certification Program

We maintain certification under the Joint Certification Program, a program between Canada’s Department of National
Defense and the U.S. Department of Defense, that helps to protect controlled Unclassified Military Critical Technical
Data (MCTD) and technology from common adversaries. Our Joint Certification Program certification establishes the
eligibility of Spectro Cloud, Inc., to receive technical data governed by the Technical Data Control Regulations (TCDR).
