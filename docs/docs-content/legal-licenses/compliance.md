## ISO 27001:2022

![ISO 27001 logo](/legal-licenses_compliance_iso-27001.webp "#width=300px")

The International Organization for Standardization 27001 Standard (ISO 27001) is one of the leading international
standards focused on information security. Spectro Cloud has obtained the ISO 27001:2022 Certification and undergoes
periodic audits to maintain this certification. ISO 27001:2022 Certification provides assurances that Spectro Cloud is
identifying and managing risks effectively, consistently, and measurably.

Below are some reasons why an ISO 27001:2022 Certification is important:

- **Customer trust and confidence**: Clients and partners often look for assurances that their sensitive information is
  handled securely. Achieving ISO 27001:2022 certification can enhance customer trust and confidence, potentially
  leading to increased business opportunities.

- **Risk Management**: By implementing ISO controls and measures, companies can mitigate these risks, protecting
  sensitive data from unauthorized access or disclosure.

- **Legal and regulatory compliance**: Adhering to ISO 27001:2022 demonstrates a commitment to information security,
  which can help organizations comply with various legal and regulatory requirements related to data protection and
  privacy.

- **Global recognition**: ISO 27001:2022 is globally recognized. This helps organizations communicate their commitment
  to information security across borders.

## SOC 2 Type II

The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Service Organization Controls (SOC) Attestation provides
assurances over control environments. Spectro Cloud’s SOC 2 Type II audit report provides assurances of our
organization’s security and availability.

- SOC 2 audits are an important component in regulatory oversight, vendor management programs, internal governance, and
  risk management.

- These reports help our users and their auditors understand the controls established at Spectro Cloud to support
  operations and compliance.

- Spectro Cloud’s SOC 2 Type II report is available upon request for any customers or prospects with a signed
  non-disclosure agreement in place.

We maintain certification under the Joint Certification Program, a program between Canada’s Department of National
Defense and the U.S. Department of Defense, that helps to protect controlled Unclassified Military Critical Technical
Data (MCTD) and technology from common adversaries. Our Joint Certification Program certification establishes the
eligibility of Spectro Cloud, Inc., to receive technical data governed by the Technical Data Control Regulations (TCDR).
