Palette contains many system settings you can configure to meet your organization's needs. These settings are available
at the system level and are applied to all [tenants](../../glossary-all.md#tenant) in the system.

:::warning

Exercise caution when changing system settings, as the changes will be applied to all tenants in the system.

## System Console

The system console enables you to complete the initial setup and onboarding and manage the overall Palette environment.

### Access the System Console

You can access the system console by visiting the IP address or the custom domain name assigned to your Palette cluster
and appending the `/system` path to the URL. For example, if your Palette cluster is hosted at
`https://palette.abc.com`, you can access the system console at `https://palette.abc.com/system`.

- [Account management](account-management/account-management.md)
