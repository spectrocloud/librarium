You can manage the credentials of the admin user by logging in to the system console. You can also enable passkeys to access the admin panel. The passkey feature supports both virtual passkey and physical passkey.

Use the sections below to learn how to manage user credentials.


## Change Password

Use the following steps to change the password of the admin user.

### Prerequisites

- Access to the Palette system console.

- Current password of the admin user.

- A Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server must be configured in the system console. Refer to [Configure SMTP](../smtp.md) page for guidance on how to configure an SMTP server.

### Steps

1. Log in to the Palette system console. Refer to [Access the System Console](../system-management.md#access-the-system-console) guide.

2. From the **left Main Menu** select **My Account**.

3. In the field **Current Password** type the current password of the admin user.

4. In the field **New Password** type the new password for the admin user.

5. Type the new password again in the field **Re-Enter New Password**.

6. Click **Change Password** to save the changes.


### Validate 

1. Log out of the system console. You can log out by clicking the **Logout** button in the bottom right corner of the **left Main Menu**.

2. Log in to the system console. Refer to [Access the System Console](../system-management.md#access-the-system-console) guide.

2. Use the new email address and your current password to log in to the system console.

A successful login indicates that the password has been changed successfully.


## Add Passkeys

VerteX supports the usage of passkeys (using the [WebAuthn Level2 protocol](https://developers.yubico.com/WebAuthn/Concepts/WebAuthn_Level_2_Features_and_Enhancements.html)) to authenticate. When you enable passkeys, the admin user will still be required to provide an email address and password to log in to the system console. However, the admin user will also be required to provide a passkey to log in to the system console. 

The passkey can be a password manager, a physical device, or a web browser that supports the WebAuthn Level2 protocol. A maximum of two passkeys can be added for the admin user.

:::danger

We recommend you create at least two passkeys for the admin user, in case you lose the ability to access the passkey. If you lose all passkeys, you will not be able to log in to the system console. Contact the support team to discuss recovery options.

### Prerequisites

- Access to the Palette system console.


- A password manager, physical device, or a web browser that supports the WebAuthn Level2 protocol to create passkeys. We recommend you use a physical device, such as a YubiKey, to create passkeys that comply with the standards and regulations of your organization.


- If you are using a self-signed certificate, or a certificate signed by an unknown certificate authority (CA) for Palette that is not trusted by the browser, you may have to add the certificate to the operating system's trust store or certificate store before you can add passkeys. Different browsers behave differently in how strict they are in enforcing the trust of the certificate. For example, Chrome is more strict than Firefox. Refer to the documentation of your operating system for guidance on how to add a certificate to the trust store or certificate store:

  - [MacOS](https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/add-certificates-to-a-keychain-kyca2431/mac) - Use the application, Keychain Access, to add the server certificate to the system keychain.

  - [Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/certmgr) - Use the command-line tool `CertMgr` in PowerShell to add the server certificate to the local machine store.

5. The passkey will be added to the list of passkeys. You can use the **Delete** button to delete the passkey.


### Validate

1. Log out of the system console. You can log out by clicking the **Logout** button in the bottom right corner of the **left Main Menu**.

2. Log in to the system console. Refer to [Access the System Console](../system-management.md#access-the-system-console) guide.

A successful login indicates that the passkey has been added successfully.
