Palette is available as a self-hosted platform offering. You can install the self-hosted version of Palette in your data centers or public cloud providers to manage Kubernetes clusters. You can install Palette by using the following four methods:


- [VMware Quick Start](deploying-the-platform-installer.md)


- [VMware Enterprise](deploying-an-enterprise-cluster.md)


- [Kubernetes Install Helm Chart](deploying-palette-with-helm.md)


- [AirGap Install](air-gap-repo.md)

## VMware Quick Start

A single-node Palette installation that is ideal for Proof of Concept (PoC) environments. Refer to the [Quick Start Installation](deploying-the-platform-installer.md) guide for more details.

## VMware Enterprise

A highly available multi-node Palette installation that is typically used for production purposes. Check out the [Enterprise Mode](deploying-an-enterprise-cluster.md) guide to get started.

## Kubernetes Install Helm Chart

Install Palette onto a Kubernetes cluster using a Helm Chart. Review the [Helm Chart Mode](deploying-palette-with-helm.md) guide to learn more.


## Airgap Install

Palette can be installed in a VMware environment without internet access, known as an air gap installation, requiring pre-download of platform manifests, required platform packages, container images for core components, third-party dependencies, and Palette Packs, all sourced from a private rather than the default public Palette repository.
