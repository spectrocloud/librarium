This section helps you prepare your VMware vSphere airgap environment for Palette installation. There are two ways to
prepare your environment:

1. If you have a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) VM deployed in your environment, follow the
   [Environment Setup with an Existing RHEL VM](./env-setup-vm.md) guide to learn how to prepare this VM for Palette
   installation.
2. If you do not have a VM, follow the [Environment Setup with OVA](./vmware-vsphere-airgap-instructions.md) guide. This
   guide will show you how to use an OVA to deploy a airgap support VM in your VMware vSphere environment, which will
   assist with the Palette installation.
