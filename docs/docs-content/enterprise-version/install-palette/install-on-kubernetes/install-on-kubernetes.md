Palette can be installed on Kubernetes with internet connectivity or an airgap environment. When you install Palette, a three-node cluster is created. You use a Helm chart our support team provides to install Palette on Kubernetes. Refer to [Access Palette](../../enterprise-version.md#access-palette) for instructions on requesting access to the Helm Chart.


To get started with Palette on Kubernetes, refer to the [Install Instructions](install.md) guide.
