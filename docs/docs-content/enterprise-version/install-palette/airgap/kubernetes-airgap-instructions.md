This guide provides instructions to prepare your airgap environment for a Palette installation by completing the
required preparatory steps 1 through 4 shown in the diagram. The respective installation guides for each platform cover
the remaining installation process.

## Prepare Airgap Installation

Use the following steps to prepare your airgap environment for a Palette installation.

:::tip

Carefully review the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section before proceeding. This will save you time and frustration.
Each prerequisite listed is required for a successful installation.

:::

## Prerequisites

- An x86 Linux jumpbox or bastion host with connectivity to the target platform where you are installing Palette.

- 30 GB of disk space available for the airgap setup binary and temporary files. The uncompressed airgap content is
  approximately 20 GB.

- An OCI registry such as [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/) or [AWS ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) to store Palette
  images and packages. The OCI registry must be accessible from the Kubernetes cluster. We have verified the
  installation against Harbor and AWS ECR. Other OCI registries may work but have not been tested.

:::warning

Ensure the OCI registries are set up with HTTPS. AWS ECR is enabled with HTTPS by default. Harbor requires you to enable
HTTPS. If you are using Harbor, you must enable HTTPS to authenticate with the registry. Refer to the
[Harbor](https://goharbor.io/docs/2.9.0/install-config/configure-https) documentation for guidance.

:::

- An HTTP file server to host the Palette manifest. The file server must be accessible from the target environment where
  Palette will be installed. Below is a list of common file servers:

  - [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/)

  - [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)

  - [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)

  :::warning

  Take the necessary steps to secure your file server and ensure it can automatically recover from a failure. The file
  server is a critical component of the airgap installation and must be available post-install for Palette to function
  properly.

  :::

- To interact with the OCI registry, you must have the following tools installed and available.

  - [AWS CLI v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) - Required for AWS ECR.
  - [Oras](https://oras.land/docs/installation.html) CLI v1.0.0 - This version is explicitly required for the setup
    script.
  - [zip](https://linux.die.net/man/3/zip) - Required for the setup script.
  - [unzip](https://linux.die.net/man/1/unzip) - or equivalent for extracting the manifest content from the airgap setup
    binary.
  - [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/) - Command-line JSON processor installed and available.
  - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) - The airgap setup binary requires Docker to be installed and
    available.

## Instructions

Complete the following steps before deploying the airgap Palette installation.

1. Log in to the OCI registry where you will host the Palette images and packages.

2. Create a repository with the name `spectro-packs` and ensure the repository is private. This repository will host the
   Palette Packs.

   - Refer to the [Create Projects](https://goharbor.io/docs/2.0.0/working-with-projects/create-projects/) guide for
     information about creating a repository in Harbor.
   - Refer to the [Create a repository](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/repository-create.html)
     guide for information about creating a repository in AWS ECR.

3. In your OCI registry, create another repository with the name `spectro-images` and ensure the repository is public.
   The public repositry will host the images required by Palette.

4. Log in to the Linux environment where you will download the airgap binaries and complete the remaining steps,
   including the Palette installation.

5. Authenticate with your OCI registry and acquire credentials to both repositories you created earlier. You will need
   these credentials when deploying the airgap Palette installation.

  <Tabs groupId="oci-registry"> 
  <TabItem label="Harbor" value="harbor">

Use `oras` to log in to your OCI registry. Replace the values below with your environment configuration values. Check
out the [oras login](https://oras.land/docs/commands/oras_login) documentation for information about additional CLI
flags and examples.

```shell
oras login X.X.X.X --user 'yourUserNameHere' --password 'yourPasswordHere'
```

If you are using a Harbor registry with a self-signed certificate, you will need to add the `--insecure` flag to the
`oras` command.

```shell
oras login X.X.X.X --insecure --user 'yourUserNameHere' --password 'yourPasswordHere'
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="AWS ECR" value="aws-ecr">

You can acquire the AWS ECR authentication command from the AWS ECR console. From the ECR repository details page, click
on the **View push commands** button to access the command. Refer to the
[AWS ECR Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/getting-started-cli.html#cli-authenticate-registry)
documentation for more information.

Below is the command you will use to authenticate to AWS ECR. The output of the `aws` command is passed to `oras` to
authenticate with the ECR registry. Replace the values below with your environment configuration values.

```shell
aws ecr get-login-password --region xxxxx | oras login --username AWS --password-stdin 1234567890.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

For the public image repository, use the `docker` CLI instead of using `oras`. Replace the values below with your
environment configuration values.

```shell
aws ecr-public get-login-password --region xxxxx | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin public.ecr.aws/xxxxxxx
```

  </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

:::tip

Be aware of the timeout period for the authentication token. The process of uploading images and packages to the OCI
registry can take a approximately an hour. If the authentication token expires, you will need to re-authenticate to the
OCI registry and restart the upload process.

:::

6. The airgap setup binary requires a set of environment variables to be available and populated. Depending on what OCI
   registry you are using, the environment variables will be different. Select the OCI registry you are using and
   populate the environment variables accordingly.

  <Tabs groupId="oci-registry">
  <TabItem label="Harbor" value="harbor">

<br />

    - `OCI_IMAGE_REGISTRY`: The IP address or domain name of the OCI registry.
    - `OCI_PACK_BASE`: The namespace or repository name that hosts the Palette packs.
    - `OCI_PACK_REGISTRY`: The IP address or domain name of the OCI registry.
    - `OCI_IMAGE_BASE`: The namespace or repository name that hosts the Palette images.

    ```shell
    export OCI_IMAGE_REGISTRY=<harbor-endpoint>
    export OCI_PACK_BASE=spectro-packs
    export OCI_PACK_REGISTRY=<harbor-endpoint>
    export OCI_IMAGE_BASE=spectro-images
    ```

    Example

    ```shell hideClipboard
    export OCI_IMAGE_REGISTRY=example.internal.com
    export OCI_PACK_BASE=spectro-packs
    export OCI_PACK_REGISTRY=10.10.100.48
    export OCI_IMAGE_BASE=spectro-images
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="AWS ECR" value="aws-ecr">

<br />

    - `ECR_IMAGE_REGISTRY`: The IP address or domain name of the public OCI registry for images.
    - `ECR_IMAGE_BASE`: The namespace or repository name that hosts the Palette images.
    - `ECR_IMAGE_REGISTRY_REGION`: The AWS region where the ECR registry is located.
    - `ECR_PACK_BASE`: The namespace or repository name that hosts the Palette packs.
    - `ECR_PACK_REGISTRY`: The IP address or domain name of the OCI registry.

7. Download the airgap setup binary. Our support team will provide you with the proper version and the necessary
   credentials. Replace the commands below with the recommended version and credentials provided by our support team.

```shell
VERSION=X.X.X
```

```shell
curl --user XXXXX:YYYYYYY https://software-private.spectrocloud.com/airgap/$VERSION/airgap-v$VERSION.bin  \
--output airgap-v$VERSION.bin
```

8. Update the airgap setup binary permissions to allow execution. Replace the file name below with the name of the
   airgap setup binary you downloaded.

```shell
chmod +x airgap-v$VERSION.bin
```

9. Start the airgap setup binary. Replace the file name below with the name of the airgap setup binary you downloaded.

```shell
./airgap-v$VERSION.bin
```

Upon completion, a success message will be displayed. The output in the example below is condensed for brevity.

    ```shell hideClipboard {10}
    Verifying archive integrity...  100%   MD5 checksums are OK. All good.

    ```

:::info

If you encounter an error during the airgap setup process, verify the required environment variables are set and
populated correctly. If you are still having issues, reach out to our support team for assistance.

:::

10. Move the manifest file located in your temporary directory to the location of your file server. Unzip the manifest
    file to a folder accessible by the file server. Replace the file name below with the name of the manifest file
    provided to you by the airgap setup.

    ```shell
    unzip spectro-manifests-XXXXXXXXXXXX.zip -d /target/folder
    ```

:::tip

    If you want to get started quickly with a file server, install
    [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/static-files) or use Python3's
    [http sever](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html) and issue one of the following commands in the
    folder where you unzipped the manifest content. Each command will start a file server on port 2015.

    ```shell
    caddy file-server --listen :2015 --browse
    ```

    ```shell
    python3 -m http.server 2015
    ```

    We do not recommend serving the manifest content over HTTP, but it is an option if you want to get started quickly.
    For production workloads, enable HTTPS on your file server.

:::

11. Review the additional packs available for download. The supplemental packs are optional and not required for a
    successful installation. However, to create cluster profiles you may require several of the packs available for
    download. Refer to the [Additional Packs](supplemental-packs.md) resource for a list of available packs.

12. Once you select the packs you want to install, download the pack binaries and start the binary to initiate the
    upload process.

In the example below, the `airgap-pack-aws-alb-2.5.1.bin` binary is downloaded and started.

```shell
chmod +x airgap-pack-aws-alb-2.5.1.bin && \
./airgap-pack-aws-alb-2.5.1.bin
```

```shell hideClipboard
  Verifying archive integrity...  100%   MD5 checksums are OK. All good.
  Uncompressing Airgap Pack - aws-alb Version 4.0.17  100%
  Setting up Packs
  - Pushing Pack aws-alb:2.5.1
  Setting up Images
  Setup Completed
```

13. Repeat step 12 for each pack you want to install.

You have now completed the preparation steps for an airgap installation. Check out the [Validate](#validate) section to
ensure the airgap setup process completed successfully.

## Validate

Use the following steps to validate the airgap setup process completed successfully.

1. Log in to your OCI registry and verify the Palette images and packs are available.

2. Verify the manifest file is accessible from the file server. The manifest file is required for the Palette
   installation process. The screenshot below is an example of a file server hosting the unzipped manifest content. The
   example shows Caddy as the file server.

![Example of a file server hosting the unzipped manifest content](/enterprise-version_airgap_airgap-instructions_file-server-caddy.png)

3. Ensure your file server is accessible from the environment in which you are installing Palette. Use the following
   command to verify the file server can access the manifest content. Replace the hostname or IP address below with your
   file server hostname or IP address.

```shell
curl http://<hostname>:<port>/roar/nickfury/versions.yaml
```

```yaml hideClipboard
versions:
  - version: "3.3"
    filepath: "/roar/nickfury/3.3/version.yaml"
    patchVersionsFilepath: "/roar/nickfury/3.3/versions.yaml"
  - version: "3.4"
    filepath: "/roar/nickfury/3.4/version.yaml"
    patchVersionsFilepath: "/roar/nickfury/3.4/versions.yaml"
  - version: "4.0"
    filepath: "/roar/nickfury/4.0/version.yaml"
    patchVersionsFilepath: "/roar/nickfury/4.0/versions.yaml"
```

## Next Steps

You are now ready to deploy the airgap Palette installation. You will specify your OCI registry and file server during
the installation process. Refer to the
[Kubernetes Install Instructions](../install-on-kubernetes/install-on-kubernetes.md) guide for detailed guidance on
installing Palette.
