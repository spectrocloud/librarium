Palette is available as a self-hosted application that you install in your environment. The self-hosted version is a
dedicated Palette environment hosted on VMware instances or in an existing Kubernetes cluster. Palette is available in
the following modes:

| **Supported Platform** | **Description**                                                       | **Install Guide**                                         |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| VMware                 | Install Palette in VMware environment.                                | [Install on VMware](install-on-vmware/install.md)         |
| Kubernetes             | Install Palette using a Helm Chart in an existing Kubernetes cluster. | [Install on Kubernetes](install-on-kubernetes/install.md) |

You can also install Palette in an airgap environment. For more information, refer to the
[Airgap Installation](airgap/airgap.md) section.

| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| VMware                        | Install Palette in VMware environment using your own OCI registry server.                                              |
| Kubernetes                    | Install Palette using a Helm Chart in an existing Kubernetes cluster with your own OCI registry server OR use AWS ECR. |

The next sections provide sizing guidelines we recommend you review before installing Palette in your environment.

## Size Guidelines

This section lists resource requirements for Palette for various capacity levels. In Palette VerteX, the terms _small_,
_medium_, and _large_ are used to describe the instance size of worker pools that Palette is installed on. The following
table lists the resource requirements for each size.

<br />

:::warning

The recommended maximum number of deployed nodes and clusters in the environment should not be exceeded. We have tested
the performance of Palette with the recommended maximum number of deployed nodes and clusters. Exceeding these limits
can negatively impact performance and result in instability. The active workload limit refers to the maximum number of
active nodes and pods at any given time.

#### Instance Sizing

| **Configuration**    | **Active Workload Limit**                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Small                | Up to 1000 Nodes each with 30 Pods (30,000 Pods)  |
| Medium (Recommended) | Up to 3000 Nodes each with 30 Pods (90,000 Pods)  |
| Large                | Up to 5000 Nodes each with 30 Pods (150,000 Pods) |

## Proxy Requirements

- A proxy used for outgoing connections should support both HTTP and HTTPS traffic.

- Allow connectivity to domains and ports in the table.
