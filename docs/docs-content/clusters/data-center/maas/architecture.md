Canonical MAAS is an open source tool that lets you discover, commission, deploy and re-deploy operating systems to
physical servers. The following are some architectural highlights of bare-metal Kubernetes clusters that Palette deploys
using Canonical MAAS. Refer to the PCG deployment options section below to learn more about PCG deployment.

- Palette integrates with MAAS through Spectro Cloudâ€™s open source Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)
  [Cluster API provider](https://github.com/spectrocloud/cluster-api-provider-maas). Refer to the table below

- Palette provides a cloud-like experience for deploying clusters on bare metal servers. The result is increased
  performance at minimal cost and operational effort.

- A Private Cloud Gateway (PCG) that you install in a MAAS cloud using a local installer facilitates communication
  between Palette and MAAS. The PCG is necessary in MAAS environments where Palette does not have direct network access
  to the MAAS server. Since MAAS environments are typically in a private network without a central endpoint, the PCG
  provides this endpoint and also wraps the MAAS environment into a cloud account that you can target for cluster
  deployment in Palette. Refer to the section below to learn about the PCG deployment options you have.

- When the PCG is installed, it registers itself with a Palette instance and enables secure communication between the
  SaaS portal and the private cloud environment. The gateway enables installation and end-to-end lifecycle management of
  Kubernetes clusters in private cloud environments from Palette's SaaS portal.

  The diagram below illustrates how MAAS works with Palette using a PCG.
