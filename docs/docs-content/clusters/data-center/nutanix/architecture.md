[Nutanix](https://www.nutanix.com) is a private data center-based cloud that can be registered to Palette using
Palette's generic framework built upon the open-source Cluster API (CAPI) initiative. Nutanix offers a hyper-converged
infrastructure (HCI) that combines storage, compute, and networking into a single integrated system.

Below are key architectural highlights of Nutanix clusters provisioned through Palette.

- Palette integrates with Nutanix through the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)
  [Nutanix Cluster API Infrastructure Provider](https://github.com/nutanix-cloud-native/cluster-api-provider-nutanix).

- Nutanix Prism is a resource management platform that centralizes the monitoring and management of objects across
  Nutanix environments, whether hosted in your data center or a public cloud provider environment. Nutanix Prism has two
  main components: Prism Central (PC) and Prism Element (PE).

  - Prism Central is a workspace in which you can register and manage Nutanix workload clusters. The Cluster API
    Provider Nutanix Cloud Infrastructure (CAPX) relies on Prism Central APIs to manage the Kubernetes cluster
    infrastructure resources.

  - Prism Element is a localized cluster manager available for every deployed Nutanix cluster. Within Prism Element, you
    can configure a cluster, specifying its components such as the number of control plane and worker nodes, networking
    settings, and more.

- The Kubernetes API Server endpoint is accessible through [kube-vip](https://kube-vip.io/), which is a load balancing
  solution for the clusterâ€™s control plane. Kube-vip distributes API requests across control plane nodes and also has
  failover capabilities.

- A Self-hosted Private Cloud Gateway (PCG) is required to enable Palette to securely communicate with the Nutanix
  cloud. The direct communication channel allows Palette to create and monitor clusters within the Nutanix cloud. A
  self-hosted cluster is needed for the PCG deployment. The
  [Deploy a Kubernetes Cluster to Host the PCG](./install-pcg/deploy-kubernetes-cluster-pcg.md) page provides the steps
  to deploy a self-hosted cluster within the Nutanix infrastructure.

The following diagram illustrates the Nutanix architecture.
