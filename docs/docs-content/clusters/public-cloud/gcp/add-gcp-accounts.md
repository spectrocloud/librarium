Palette supports integration with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) accounts. This section explains how to create a GCP cloud account in Palette. 

## Prerequisites

* You must have a GCP service account available for use with Palette. For detailed instructions on creating a service account, refer to [Creating and managing service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts).



* The service account must, at a minimum, have the following roles. 

    - [Kubernetes Engine Admin](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#kubernetes-engine-roles)

    - [Compute Admin](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#compute.admin)

    - [Service Account User](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#iam.serviceAccountUser)

    - [Storage Object Viewer](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#storage.objectViewer)

    <br />

    :::info

    Alternatively, you can create a custom role and assign Palette the required GCP permissions. Check out the [Required IAM Permission](required-permissions.md) for a detailed list of all permissions.

    :::




* Ensure you have access to the JSON credential file for your service account. For additional guidance, refer to the [GCP Credentials](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials) documentation.
