## AWS Account

This section provides guidance on creating an AWS account that uses static or dynamic access credentials.

### Static Access Credentials

Use the steps below to add an AWS cloud account using static access credentials.

#### Prerequisites

- A Palette account with [tenant admin](../../../tenant-settings/tenant-settings.md) access

- An AWS account with an [IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html) or [IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) for Palette

- An AWS account with the [required IAM policies](required-iam-policies.md) assigned to the Palette IAM user or IAM role

#### Add AWS Account to Palette
