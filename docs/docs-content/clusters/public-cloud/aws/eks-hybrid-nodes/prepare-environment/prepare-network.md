Preparing your network for Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes involves configuring both the AWS environment and your edge location.
Youâ€™ll also need a secure inter-site connection to enable communication between the edge hosts and your Amazon
EKS cluster.

The three main areas you need to configure are:

1. AWS Region
2. Edge Location
3. Inter-Site Connectivity

This section provides example configurations for each of these areas. The full example is represented in the following diagram.

## AWS Region

- Outline required subnets, route tables, NAT/IGW, security groups, etc.

## Edge Location

- Describe the local environment, IP ranges, firewall settings, and DNS considerations.

## Inter-Site Connectivity

- Provide details on typical VPN or AWS Direct Connect setups, including routing, BGP settings, and required IP address
  blocks.
