Before Palette can manage your Amazon EKS cluster and Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes, you must suitably prepare your environment. The high level steps are as follows:

<!-- - Configure your AWS and edge networks to allow communication between your Kubernetes control plane, worker nodes, and pods.

- Configure IAM credentials for your edge hosts using either AWS Systems Manager (AWS SSM) or AWS IAM Roles Anywhere. -->

- Register your edge hosts with Palette using either Agent Mode or Appliance Mode.

- Create your Amazon EKS cluster with the configuration necessary to be imported into Palette.
