This section guides you on how to create a cluster profile to collectively manage your hybrid nodes. You can then create
hybrid node pools and add your edge hosts to them.

## Limitations

- Overall cluster health is determined by the Amazon EKS cluster's status. While unhealthy edge hosts will appear as
  unhealthy nodes in Palette, this does not change the Amazon EKS cluster's overall health status.

## Create Cluster Profile for Hybrid Node Pools

### Prerequisites

- Your Palette account role must have the `clusterProfile.create` permission to create a cluster profile. Refer to the
  [Cluster Profile](../../../../user-management/palette-rbac/project-scope-roles-permissions.md#cluster-profile)
  permissions for guidance.

### Create Profile

1. Log in to [Palette](https://spectrocloud.com).

2. From the left **Main Menu**, select **Profiles**.

3. On the **Profiles** page, click **Add Cluster Profile**.

4. Fill out the basic information and ensure **Type** is set to **Full**. Click **Next** when done.

5. Select **Edge Native** from the **Infrastructure provider** list, and click **Next**.

6. Select your base OS pack depending on how you will register your edge hosts.

   - For Agent Mode, select **BYOS - Agent Mode**.
   - For provider images, select **BYOS - Edge OS**.

7. If selecting **BYOS - Agent Mode**, on the **Configure Pack** page, click **Values** under **Pack Details**.

   Click on **Presets** on the right-hand side, and select **Agent Mode**.

8. Click **Next layer** to continue.

9.  Select **Nodeadm** as your base Kubernetes pack, and click **Next**.

10. On the **Configure Pack** page, under **Pack Version**, select your Kubernetes version from the **drop-down Menu**.

11. In the YAML editor, make any changes you need for the kubelet or containerd configuration. Refer to [Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes Configuration](https://github.com/aws/eks-hybrid?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration) for guidance on the available options.

12. Click **Next layer** to continue.

13. Select **Custom CNI** as your base Network pack, and click **Next**.

14. In the YAML editor on the **Configure Pack** page, change the value of `manifests.byo-cni.contents.data.custom-cni` from `calico` to `dummy`.

    While this change is not required for the pack to function, setting it to 'dummy' better indicates that this pack serves as a placeholder only.

15. Click **Confirm** when complete.

16. In **Profile Layers**, click **Next** to continue.

17. Click **Finish Configuration**.

Your cluster profile for hybrid nodes is now created and can be used in the [Create Hybrid Node Pool](#create-hybrid-node-pool) steps.

### Validate

1. Log in to [Palette](https://spectrocloud.com).

2. From the left **Main Menu**, select **Profiles**.

3. On the **Profiles** page, click on your newly created profile.

4. Check that your profile layers are present and correct.

## Create Hybrid Node Pool

### Prerequisites

- An Amazon EKS cluster imported with hybrid mode enabled. Refer to [Import EKS Cluster and Enable Hybrid Mode](./import-eks-cluster-enable-hybrid-mode.md) for guidance.

- Edge hosts have been registered with Palette through
  [Agent Mode](../../../../deployment-modes/agent-mode/agent-mode.md) or by using
  [provider images](../../../edge/edgeforge-workflow/palette-canvos/build-provider-images.md).

  :::warning

  If using provider images, you must include the following in your `.arg` file during the
  [build steps](../../../edge/edgeforge-workflow/palette-canvos/build-provider-images.md#build-provider-images).

  ```shell
  K8S_DISTRIBUTION=nodeadm
  K8S_VERSION=<kubernetesVersion>  # supported versions: [ 1.28.0 | 1.29.0 | 1.30.0 | 1.31.0 ]
  ```

  Replace `<kubernetesVersion>` with your version of Kubernetes. For example, `1.29.0`.

  :::

- A cluster profile created for your hybrid nodes. Refer to [Create Cluster Profile for Hybrid Node Pools](#create-cluster-profile-for-hybrid-node-pools) for steps.

### Create Node Pool

1. Log in to [Palette](https://spectrocloud.com).

2. From the left **Main Menu**, select **Clusters**.

3. Select your cluster to view its **Overview** tab.

4. Select the **Nodes** tab.

5. In the top-right, click **New Node Pool**.

6. In the pop-up window, fill in the following fields.

   | **Field** | **Description** |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Node pool name** | A descriptive name for the hybrid node pool. |
   | **Additional Labels (Optional)**           | Labels can apply placement constraints on a pod. For example, you can add a label to make a node eligible to receive the workload. To learn more, refer to the [Node Labels](../../../cluster-management/node-labels.md) guide.  |
   | **Taints**                      | Sets toleration to pods and allows (but does not require) the pods to schedule onto nodes with matching taints. To learn more, refer to the [Taints and Tolerations](../../../cluster-management/taints.md) guide.  |
   | **Hybrid Profile**             | Click in the field and select the cluster profile you [created for your hybrid nodes](#create-cluster-profile-for-hybrid-node-pools). Click **Configure**. Review the layers and click **Confirm**.  |
   | **Architecture**               | Select the architecture type for your edge hosts. Either **AMD64** or **ARM64**.  |
   | **NTP Servers (Optional)**          | The Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers to use for the hybrid nodes. For example, `pool.ntp.org`. |
   | **Nodes (edge hosts)** | Click **Add Edge Hosts**. Select your edge hosts from the table by clicking the checkbox next to the **Machine ID**. Click **Confirm** once done. |

7. Once your edge hosts have been selected, click **Configure** next to each edge host to review and configure individual host options.

   | **Field** | **Description** |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Host Name (Optional)** | Provide a optional name for the edge host that will be displayed in Palette. |
   | **NIC Name**           | Select a specific Network Interface Card (NIC) from the **drop-down Menu**, or leave it on **Auto**.  |
   | **VPN server IP**                      | Specify the VPN server's IP if the hybrid nodes in the pool use a VPN. If provided, a static route will be configured on edge hosts to route traffic to the Amazon EKS VPC CIDR through the VPN server. If not specified, ensure your hybrid node network routes traffic to the Amazon EKS VPC CIDR through the default gateway.  |

   Click **Confirm** once done.

8. Repeat step 7 for each edge host added to your node pool.

9. Click **Confirm** on the **Add node pool** pop-up window to add the hybrid node pool to your cluster.

The hybrid node pool will then be provisioned and added to your cluster. This will take up to 15 minutes.

### Validate

1. Log in to [Palette](https://spectrocloud.com).

2. From the left **Main Menu**, select **Clusters**.

3. Select your cluster to view its **Overview** tab.

4. Select the **Nodes** tab.

5. Your newly added hybrid node pool displays as **Running**.
