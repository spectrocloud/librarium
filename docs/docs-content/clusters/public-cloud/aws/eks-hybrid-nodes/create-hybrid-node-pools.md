This section guides you on how to create a cluster profile to collectively manage your Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service
(Amazon EKS) Hybrid Nodes. You can then create hybrid node pools and add your edge hosts to them.

You must then configure your networking to allow traffic to reach the pods on your hybrid nodes.

## Limitations

- Overall cluster health is determined by the Amazon EKS cluster's status. While unhealthy edge hosts will appear as
  unhealthy nodes in Palette, this does not change the Amazon EKS cluster's overall health status.

## Create Cluster Profile for Hybrid Node Pools

### Prerequisites

- Your Palette account role must have the `clusterProfile.create` permission to create a cluster profile. Refer to the
  [Cluster Profile](../../../../user-management/palette-rbac/project-scope-roles-permissions.md#cluster-profile)
  permissions for guidance.

- The manifest output for your provider image that was created during the
  [Register Edge Host in Appliance Mode](./prepare-environment/prepare-edge-hosts.md#register-edge-host-in-appliance-mode)
  steps.

### Create Profile

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com/).

2. From the left **Main Menu**, select **Profiles**.

3. On the **Profiles** page, click **Add Cluster Profile**.

4. Fill out the basic information and ensure **Type** is set to **Full**. Click **Next** when done.

5. Select **Edge Native** from the **Infrastructure provider** list, and click **Next**.

6. Select **BYOS - Edge OS** as your base OS pack.

7. If using [Agent Mode](../../../../deployment-modes/agent-mode/agent-mode.md), on the **Configure Pack** page, click
   **Values** under **Pack Details**. Then, click on **Presets** on the right-hand side, and select **Agent Mode**.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
8. If using [Appliance Mode](../../../../deployment-modes/appliance-mode.md), on the **Configure Pack** page, click
   **Values** under **Pack Details**. Then, replace the contents of the pack manifest with your built image
   manifest.

   Example.

   ```yaml hideClipboard
   pack:
     content:
       images:
         - image: '{{.spectro.pack.edge-native-byoi.options.system.uri}}'
     # Below config is default value, please uncomment if you want to modify default values
     #drain:
       #cordon: true
       #timeout: 60 # The length of time to wait before giving up, zero means infinite
       #gracePeriod: 60 # Period of time in seconds given to each pod to terminate gracefully. If negative, the default value specified in the pod will be used
       #ignoreDaemonSets: true
       #deleteLocalData: true # Continue even if there are pods using emptyDir (local data that will be deleted when the node is drained)
       #force: true # Continue even if there are pods that do not declare a controller
       #disableEviction: false # Force drain to use delete, even if eviction is supported. This will bypass checking PodDisruptionBudgets, use with caution
       #skipWaitForDeleteTimeout: 60 # If pod DeletionTimestamp older than N seconds, skip waiting for the pod. Seconds must be greater than 0 to skip.
    options:
      system.uri: "{{ .spectro.pack.edge-native-byoi.options.system.registry }}/{{ .spectro.pack.edge-native-byoi.options.system.repo }}:{{ .spectro.pack.edge-native-byoi.options.system.k8sDistribution }}-{{ .spectro.system.kubernetes.version }}-{{ .spectro.pack.edge-native-byoi.options.system.peVersion }}-{{ .spectro.pack.edge-native-byoi.options.system.customTag }}"

      system.registry: ttl.sh
      system.repo: ubuntu
      system.k8sDistribution: nodeadm
      system.osName: ubuntu
      system.peVersion: v4.5.15
      system.customTag: eks-hybrid
      system.osVersion: 22
   ```

9. Click **Next layer** to continue.

10. Select **Nodeadm** as your base Kubernetes pack, and click **Next**.

11. On the **Configure Pack** page, under **Pack Version**, select your Kubernetes version from the **drop-down Menu**.

12. In the YAML editor, make any changes you need for the kubelet or containerd configuration. Refer to
    [Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes Configuration](https://github.com/aws/eks-hybrid?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration) for
    guidance on the available options.

13. Click **Next layer** to continue.

14. Select **Custom CNI** as your base Network pack, and click **Next**.

15. In the YAML editor on the **Configure Pack** page, change the value of `manifests.byo-cni.contents.data.custom-cni`
    from `calico` to `dummy`.

    :::info

    While this change is not required for the pack to function, setting it to `dummy` better indicates that this pack
    serves as a placeholder only. This is because the Container Network Interface (CNI) was already created for hybrid
    nodes during the [Add CNI Cluster Profile](./import-eks-cluster-enable-hybrid-mode.md#add-cni-cluster-profile)
    steps.

    :::

16. Click **Confirm** when complete.

17. In **Profile Layers**, click **Next** to continue.

18. Click **Finish Configuration**.

Your cluster profile for hybrid nodes is now created and can be used in the
[Create Hybrid Node Pool](#create-hybrid-node-pool) steps.

### Validate

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com/).

2. From the left **Main Menu**, select **Profiles**.

3. On the **Profiles** page, click on your newly created profile.

4. Check that your profile layers are present and correct.

## Create Hybrid Node Pool

### Prerequisites

- An Amazon EKS cluster imported with hybrid mode enabled. Refer to
  [Import EKS Cluster and Enable Hybrid Mode](./import-eks-cluster-enable-hybrid-mode.md) for guidance.

- Edge hosts have been registered with Palette using the steps in
  [Prepare Edge Hosts](./prepare-environment/prepare-edge-hosts.md).

- A cluster profile created for your hybrid nodes. Refer to
  [Create Cluster Profile for Hybrid Node Pools](#create-cluster-profile-for-hybrid-node-pools) for steps.

- Verified network connectivity between your Amazon EKS cluster nodes and edge hosts. Refer to [Prepare Network - Inter-Site Connectivity](./prepare-environment/prepare-network.md#validate-2) for guidance.

  - If using a VPN, confirm that both tunnels of the site-to-site VPN connection are active and operational.

  - Ensure that a debug pod deployed on one of the Amazon EKS cluster's cloud worker nodes can successfully ping your
    edge hosts.

    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <details>
    <summary> Example ping command </summary>

    ```shell
    kubectl exec --stdin=true --tty=true <debugPodName> -- ping <edgeHostIpAddress>
    ```

    </details>

  - Verify that your edge hosts can successfully ping the private IP address of an EC2 instance within the Amazon EKS
    cluster's VPC.

## Configure Hybrid Node Networking for VPN Solutions

This section explains how to configure your VPN with static routes to enable network traffic to reach pods on hybrid
nodes. Before proceeding, consider the following points:

- This guide is specifically for VPN solutions that support and require manual static route configuration. If your VPN
  uses a different routing mechanism, these steps may not apply.

- If your VPN supports BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), you may be able to skip manual route configuration entirely. BGP
  can automatically advertise and update routes between your cluster and VPN. Check your VPN documentation for BGP
  neighbor configuration and route import procedures.

- These steps outline the general process for configuring a VPN with static routes. Refer to your VPN documentation for
  provider-specific configuration details.

### Prerequisites

- Your hybrid node pool has been created and configured. Refer to [Create Hybrid Node Pool](#create-hybrid-node-pool)
  for guidance.

- Ensure [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) is installed and available in your local workstation.

- Access to your Amazon EKS cluster through kubectl.

  - To access your cluster with kubectl, you can use the AWS CLI's built-in authentication capabilities. If you are
    using a custom OIDC provider, you will need to configure your kubeconfig to use your OIDC provider.

    Refer to the
    [Access Imported Cluster with Kubectl](./import-eks-cluster-enable-hybrid-mode.md#access-imported-cluster-with-kubectl)
    section for more information.

- Access to your VPN configuration interface.

### Configure Networking

1. Issue the following kubectl command to list all CiliumNode resources in your cluster.

   ```shell
   kubectl get ciliumnode --output wide
   ```

   Example output.

   ```shell hideClipboard
   NAME                                    CILIUMINTERNALIP   INTERNALIP    AGE
   edge-abc123def4567890example1           192.168.5.101      10.200.1.23   2h
   edge-xyz987uvw6543210example2           192.168.6.102      10.200.0.34   3h
   ```

2. For each hybrid node, retrieve the `spec.ipam.podCIDRs` field to find the CIDR block allocated for pods active on
   that node.

   Replace `<nodeName>` with the name of your hybrid node discovered in step 1. Repeat this step for each hybrid node
   found.

   ```shell
   kubectl get ciliumnode <nodeName> --output yaml | grep "podCIDRs" --after-context 1
   ```

   Example output.

   ```shell hideClipboard
       podCIDRs:
       - 192.168.5.0/25
   ```

3. Access your VPN configuration interface. This could be a web UI, command-line tool, or API, depending on your VPN
   solution.

4. For each hybrid node, add the following entries.

   | **Field**              | **Description**                                                                                                         | **Example**      |
   | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
   | **Destination**        | Use the `podCIDRs` value for the hybrid node discovered in step 2.                                                      | `192.168.5.0/25` |
   | **Next Hop / Gateway** | Specify the IP address of the hybrid node as listed in the CiliumNode resource under `internalIP` discovered in step 1. | `10.200.1.23`    |

5. Ensure the routes are saved and applied. The process varies depending on the VPN solution.

### Validate

1. Deploy a lightweight debug pod in your Amazon EKS cluster if one does not exist.

   The following example command creates pod named `debug-pod` using the busybox image, which includes basic networking
   utilities. The pod will stay alive for 1 hour (3600 seconds).

   ```shell
   kubectl run debug-pod --image=busybox --restart=Never -- sleep 3600
   ```

2. From the debug pod in your Amazon EKS cluster, attempt to reach an active hybrid node.

   Replace `<debugPodName>` with the debug pod name in your Amazon EKS cluster and `<hybridNodeIp>` with an IP address
   from an active hybrid node.

   ```shell
   kubectl exec -it <debugPodName> -- ping -- ping <hybridNodeIp>
   ```

3. Check that the ping statistics from the output show a healthy connection.

   Example healthy output.

   ```shell hideClipboard
   PING 10.200.1.23 (10.200.1.23): 56 data bytes
   64 bytes from 10.200.1.23: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=28.382 ms

   round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 27.359/28.875/30.345/1.091 ms
   ```

4. From an edge host in your on-prem environment, attempt to reach your AWS VPC gateway.

   Replace `<awsVpcGateway>` with the IP address of your AWS VPC gateway, for example, `10.100.0.1`.

   ```shell
   ping <awsVpcGateway>
   ```

5. Check that the ping statistics from the output show a healthy connection.

   Example healthy output.

   ```shell hideClipboard
   PING 10.100.0.1 (10.100.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
   64 bytes from 10.100.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=27.5 ms

   rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 27.5/28.2/29.1/0.6 ms
   ```

## When to Manually Repave Hybrid Node Pools

Your hybrid node pools require manual repaving in these scenarios:

- After modifying the **Access Management** settings of your Amazon EKS cluster in Palette. Refer to steps 11 through 13
  in [Import Cluster](./import-eks-cluster-enable-hybrid-mode.md#import-cluster).
- After changing an edge host's **VPN Server IP**. Refer to step 7 in [Create Node Pool](#create-node-pool).
- After changing any configuration in the Kubernetes layer of the Node Pool **Hybrid Profile**.

These changes do not take effect until you repave the affected node pools.

- For **Access Management** changes, repave all hybrid node pools.
- For **VPN Server IP** changes, repave only the node pool containing the modified edge host.
- For **Hybrid Profile** changes, repave only the node pool containing the modified profile.

### Prerequisites

- Your Palette account role must have the `cluster.update` permission to edit clusters. Refer to the
  [Cluster Profile](../../../../user-management/palette-rbac/project-scope-roles-permissions.md#cluster-profile)
  permissions for guidance.

### Trigger Repave on Hybrid Node Pool

Use the following steps to manually trigger a repave on a hybrid node pool.

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com/).

2. From the left **Main Menu**, select **Profiles**.

3. On the **Profiles** page, click on your hybrid node pool cluster profile.

4. You can confirm that this cluster profile is managing your hybrid node pool by viewing the **In Use Clusters** list.
   Your hybrid node pool names are listed here.

   ![Edit Hybrid Profile](/aws_eks-hybrid_create-hybrid-node-pools_in-use-clusters.webp)

5. Click on the version drop-down and select **Create new version**. The version creation dialog appears.

6. Fill in a new value in the **Version** input field and click **Confirm**. The new cluster profile version is created
   with the same layers as the current version.

7. You will need to make changes to the cluster profile based on how you registered your edge hosts.

   - For Agent Mode, select the **Kubernetes** layer of your cluster profile. Next, select a Kubernetes pack version
     that is one minor version lower than your current selection. For example, select **1.29.x** if your cluster profile
     is configured with **1.30.x**.
   - For Appliance Mode, select the **OS** layer of your cluster profile. Next, click **Values** in the **Pack Details**
     section. Edit the `options.system.uri` with another provider image value.

8. Click **Confirm Updates** to save your changes.

9. From the left **Main Menu**, select **Clusters**.

10. Select your cluster to view its **Overview** tab.

11. Select the **Nodes** tab.

12. Click **Edit** on the node pool that you wish to trigger a repave on. The **Edit node pool** screen appears.
