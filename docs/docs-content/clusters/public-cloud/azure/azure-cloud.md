Palette supports integration with Azure and
[Azure Government](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/government) cloud accounts. This
section explains how to add an Azure cloud account in Palette or Palette VerteX. You can use any of the following
authentication methods to register your cloud account.

## Prerequisites

- A [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com/), or VerteX account.

- An active [Azure cloud account](https://portal.azure.com/) with sufficient resource limits and permissions to
  provision compute, network, and security resources in the desired regions. Refer to the
  [Required Permissions](./required-permissions.md) section for more information.

- An [Azure App](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview) with valid credentials.

2. From the left **Main Menu**, select **Tenant Settings**.

3. Next, on the **Tenant Settings Menu**, select **Cloud Accounts**.

account from Palette.

## Next Steps

After you have added your Azure cloud account to Palette or VerteX, you can start deploying an Azure IaaS cluster by
following the [Create and Manage IaaS Cluster](./create-azure-cluster.md) guide, or if you prefer an Azure Managed
Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, refer to the [Create and Manage Azure AKS Cluster](./azure.md) guide. We also
encourage you to check out the [Deploy a Cluster tutorial](../deploy-k8s-cluster.md) for a detailed walkthrough of the
cluster creation process.
