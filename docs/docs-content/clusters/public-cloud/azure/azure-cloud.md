   :::info

   If you want to provide network proxy configurations to the Kubernetes clusters deployed through Palette, you must use
   a PCG cluster. Check out the [Proxy Configuration](./architecture.md#proxy-configuration) section in the Architecture
   page for more information.

## Next Steps

After you have added your Azure cloud account to Palette or VerteX, you can start deploying an Azure IaaS cluster by
following the [Create and Manage IaaS Cluster](./create-azure-cluster.md) guide, or if you prefer an Azure Managed
Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, refer to the [Create and Manage Azure AKS Cluster](./azure.md) guide. We also
encourage you to check out the [Deploy a Cluster tutorial](../deploy-k8s-cluster.md) for a detailed walkthrough of the
cluster creation process.
