Palette supports creating and managing Kubernetes clusters deployed to an Azure account. This section guides you on how
to create an IaaS Kubernetes cluster in Azure that Palette manages.

:::warning

Autoscaling is not supported for Azure IaaS clusters.

:::

## Prerequisites

- Access to an Azure cloud account.

- Palette integration with Azure account. Review [Register and Manage Azure Cloud Account](azure-cloud.md) for guidance.

- A Secure Shell (SSH) key pre-configured in your Azure environment. Refer to the
  [SSH Keys](../../cluster-management/ssh-keys.md) guide for more information about creating and managing SSH keys in
  Palette.

- An infrastructure cluster profile for Azure. Review
  [Create an Infrastructure Profile](../../../profiles/cluster-profiles/create-cluster-profiles/create-infrastructure-profile.md)
  for guidance.

- To use custom storage accounts or containers, you must create them before you create your cluster. All custom storage
  accounts and containers will be listed on the Cluster config page during the cluster creation process. For information
  about use cases for custom storage, review [Azure Storage](./architecture.md#azure-storage).

  If you need help creating a custom storage account or container, check out the
  [Create a Storage Account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal)
  guide or the [Manage Blob Containers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/blob-containers-portal).

- If you do not provide your own Virtual Network (VNet), Palette creates one for you with compute, network, and storage
  resources in Azure when it provisions Kubernetes clusters. To use a VNet that Palette creates, ensure there is
  sufficient capacity in the preferred Azure region to create the following resources:

  - Virtual CPU (vCPU)
  - VNet
  - Static Public IP addresses
  - Virtual Network Interfaces
  - Load Balancers
  - Virtual Hard Disk (VHD)
  - Managed Disks
  - Virtual Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway

## Deploy an Azure Cluster

Use the following steps to deploy an Azure cluster.

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com).

2. Ensure you are in the correct project scope.

3. From the left **Main Menu** select **Clusters**, and click on the **Add New Cluster** button.

4. Select **Deploy New Cluster** on the next page that Palette displays. This will allow you to deploy a cluster using
   your own cloud account.

5. Select **Azure** and click on the **Start Azure Configuration** button.

6. Fill out the following basic information, and click **Next** to continue.

| **Field**         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cluster Name**  | A custom name for the cluster.                                                                                                                                             |
| **Description**   | Use the description to provide context about the cluster.                                                                                                                  |
| **Tags**          | Assign any desired cluster tags. Tags on a cluster are propagated to the Virtual Machines (VMs) deployed to the target environments. Example: `region:us-west`             |
| **Cloud Account** | If you already added your Azure account in Palette, select it from the **drop-down Menu**. Otherwise, click on **Add New Account** and add your Azure account information. |

7. Select the Azure cluster profile you created, and click on **Next**. Palette displays the cluster profile layers.

8. Review the profile layers and customize parameters as desired in the YAML files that display when you select a layer.
   You can configure custom OpenID Connect (OIDC) for Azure clusters at the Kubernetes layer. Check out
   [Configure OIDC Identity Provider](../../../integrations/kubernetes.md#configure-oidc-identity-provider) for more
   information.

   :::warning

   All the OIDC options require you to map a set of users or groups to a Kubernetes RBAC role. To learn how to map a
   Kubernetes role to users and groups, refer to
   [Create Role Bindings](../../cluster-management/cluster-rbac.md#create-role-bindings).

   :::

9. Click **Next** to continue.

10. Provide the cluster configuration information listed in the following table. If you are utilizing your own VNet,
    ensure you also provide information listed in the Static Placement Settings table. If you have custom storage
    accounts or containers available, you can attach them to the cluster. To learn more about attaching custom storage
    to a cluster, check out [Azure storage](../azure/architecture.md#azure-storage).

    :::warning

    If you enable the **Disable Properties** setting when
    [registering an Azure cloud account](./azure-cloud.md#add-azure-cloud-account), Palette cannot list network
    resources on your behalf. In this case, when creating clusters, you must manually specify their virtual network
    subnets and security groups.

11. Click **Next** to continue.

12. Provide the following node pool and cloud configuration information. To learn more about node pools, review the
    [Node Pool](../../cluster-management/node-pool.md) guide.

    :::info

    By default, a master pool and one worker node pool are configured. You can add new worker pools to customize certain
    worker nodes for specialized workloads. For example, the default worker pool can be configured with the
    Standard_D2_v2 instance types for general-purpose workloads, and another worker pool with instance type
    Standard_NC12s_v3 can be configured for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) workloads.

    :::

You can apply autoscale capability to dynamically increase resources during high loads and reduce them during low loads.

    #### Cloud Configuration Settings for Worker Pool

    You can copy cloud configuration settings from the master pool, but be aware that the instance type might not get copied if it does not have accessible availability zones.

    |**Parameter**| **Description**|
    |-------------|----------------|
    |**Instance Type** | Select the instance type to use for all nodes in the node pool.|
    |**Managed disk** | Choose a storage option. For more information, refer to Microsoft's [Storage Account Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview) reference. For information about Solid State Drive (SSD) disks, refer to [Standard SSD Disks for Azure Virtual Machine Workloads](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/preview-standard-ssd-disks-for-azure-virtual-machine-workloads/) reference. |
    |**Disk size** | You can choose disk size based on your requirements. The default size is 60. |
    |**Availability zones** | The Availability Zones from which to select available servers for deployment. If you select multiple zones, Palette will deploy servers evenly across them as long as sufficient servers are available to do so. |

13. Click **Next** to continue.

14. Specify your preferred **OS Patching Schedule** for EKS-managed machines.

15. Enable any scan options you want Palette to perform, and select a scan schedule. Palette provides support for
    Kubernetes configuration security, penetration testing, and conformance testing.

16. Schedule any backups you want Palette to perform. Review
    [Backup and Restore](../../cluster-management/backup-restore/backup-restore.md) for more information.

17. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) configuration is required when you configure custom OIDC. You must map a set of
    users or groups to a Kubernetes RBAC role. To learn how to map a Kubernetes role to users and groups, refer to
    [Create Role Bindings](../../cluster-management/cluster-rbac.md#create-role-bindings). Refer to
    [Use RBAC with OIDC](../../../integrations/kubernetes.md#use-rbac-with-oidc) for an example.

18. Click on the **Validate** button and review the cluster configuration and settings summary.

19. Click **Finish Configuration** to deploy the cluster. Provisioning Azure clusters can take several minutes.

The cluster details page contains the status and details of the deployment. Use this page to track the deployment
progress.

To learn how to remove a cluster and what to do if a force delete is necessary so you do not incur unexpected costs,
refer to [Cluster Removal](../../cluster-management/remove-clusters.md).

## Validate

You can validate your cluster is up and in **Running** state.

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com).

2. Ensure you are in the correct project scope.

3. From the left **Main Menu** select **Clusters**. The **Clusters** page displays a list of all available clusters that
   Palette manages.

4. Select the cluster you deployed to review its details page. Ensure the **Cluster Status** field contains the value
   **Running**.
