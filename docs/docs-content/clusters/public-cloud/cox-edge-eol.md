In January 2024, Cox Communications ended all support for Cox Edge, their public cloud provider. Consequently, Palette
no longer supports Cox Edge and its associated features. Here's a list of alternative cloud providers you could start
using with Palette and Palette VerteX today:

- [Amazon Web Services](aws/aws.md)
- [Azure](azure/azure.md)
- [Google Cloud](gcp/gcp.md)
- [Tencent](tke.md)
