In January 2024, Cox Communications ended all support for Cox Edge, their public cloud provider. Consequently, Palette
no longer supports Cox Edge and its associated features. Here's a list of alternative cloud providers you could start
using with Palette and Palette VerteX today:

- [AWS](/clusters/public-cloud/aws/)
- [Azure](/clusters/public-cloud/azure/)
- [GCP](/clusters/public-cloud/gcp/)
- [Tencent TKE](/clusters/public-cloud/tke)
