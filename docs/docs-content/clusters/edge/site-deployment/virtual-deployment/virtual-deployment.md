Palette Edge supports deployment to virtual machines (VM). You can install Palette Edge on a VM, register it with
Palette and deploy clusters on it just like a physical Edge host. This allows you to simulate your deployment operation
before devoting physical resources.

In addition, thanks to the flexibility of virtual environments, deployment to VMs can also be a way of learning how to
work with Palette Edge. Checkout the [Deploy an Edge Cluster on VMware](./deploy-cluster.md) tutorial, which guides you
through the entire lifecycle of Edge deployment using virtual machines on VMware.
