Palette Edge supports deployment to Virtual Machines (VM). You can install Palette Edge on a VM, register it with
Palette and deploy clusters on it just like a physical Edge host. This allows you to simulate your deployment operation
before devoting physical resources.

In addition, thanks to the flexibility of virtual environments, deployment to VMs can also be a way of learning how to
work with Palette Edge. Check out the
[Deploy an Edge Cluster on VMware](../../../../tutorials/clusters/edge/deploy-cluster.md) tutorial, which guides you
through the entire lifecycle of Edge deployment using virtual machines on VMware.

Once an Edge host is registered with Palette, you can then proceed to allocate the Edge host to a cluster. For more
information, refer to [Create Cluster Definition](../cluster-deployment.md).
