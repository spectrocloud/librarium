Palette Edge allows you to provision a local Harbor image registry as part of your Edge deployment. When your Edge
cluster is created for the first time, all images from add-on packs downloaded from external registries are stored
locally in the Harbor registry. Subsequent image pulls from the cluster are made to the local Harbor registry. This
allows your Edge cluster to reboot containers or add new nodes without being connected to the external network.

If you specified the installation mode of the Edge Installer to be `airgap`, any images that were included in the Edge
Installer ISO will also be loaded into the Harbor registry. For more information about building content bundles, refer
to [Build Content Bundle](../../edgeforge-workflow/palette-canvos/build-content-bundle.md) and
[Build Edge Artifacts with Content Bundles](../../edgeforge-workflow/palette-canvos/palette-canvos.md).

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
If you enable the local Harbor registry on a cluster, the Palette agent will pull all images requested by the cluster
from the Harbor registry. If your cluster uses any image that is not included in your cluster profile, you will need to
instruct the Palette agent to not pull that image from the Harbor registry by disabling this behavior for certain
namespaces. You can do this by giving a namespace the label `stylus.io/imageswap=disable`. For more information, refer
to <VersionedLink text="Harbor Edge-Native Config pack" url="/integrations/packs/?pack=harbor-edge-native-config#enable-image-download-from-outside-of-harbor"/> documentation.

![Local Harbor Registry Architecture](/clusters_edge_networking_local_harbor_architecture.webp)

## Prerequisites

- At least one Edge host registered with your Palette account with an AMD64 or x86_64 processor architecture.

- Each of your Edge hosts must have at least 4 CPUs and 8 GB of RAM.

  - For single-node clusters, where there is only one Edge host handling both control plane and worker capabilities,
    your Edge host must have at least 6 CPUs and 12 GB of RAM.

- At least 300 GB of persistent storage. The actual amount of storage required depends on the size of your images.

- An Edge cluster profile. For information about how to create a cluster profile for Edge, refer to
  [Model Edge Cluster Profile](../../site-deployment/model-profile.md).

## Enablement

### Enable Local Harbor Registry

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com).

2. Navigate to the left **Main Menu** and select **Profiles**.

3. Select the profile you plan to use for deployment and create a new version of the profile.

4. If the profile does not already have a storage layer, click **Add New Pack** to add a storage pack. You can choose
   any storage pack for your storage layer.

5. Select the Kubernetes layer of the profile. Under `cluster.config.kube-apiserver-arg`, remove `AlwaysPullImages` from
   the list item `enable-admission-plugins`:

   ```yaml {7}
   kube-apiserver-arg:
     - anonymous-auth=true
     - profiling=false
     - disable-admission-plugins=AlwaysAdmit
     - default-not-ready-toleration-seconds=60
     - default-unreachable-toleration-seconds=60
     - enable-admission-plugins=NamespaceLifecycle,ServiceAccount,NodeRestriction
   ```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
6. Click **Add New Pack** and search for the **Harbor Edge Native Config** pack. Add the pack to your cluster profile.
   For more information about the pack and its parameters, refer to <VersionedLink text="Harbor Edge Native Config pack documentation" url="/integrations/packs/?pack=harbor-edge-native-config"/>.

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

7. In the `harbor-config.storage` parameter, make sure you allocate enough storage in the `registry` field to store all
   your images.

### Provide Credentials to Private Registries (Optional)

If your cluster profile does not reference a private registry for images or helm charts or you have configured the
Palette agent to download all images from an external private registry, you can skip this step.

:::info

Configuring external registries through user data will instruct the Palette agent to download all images from the
external registry and prepend the registry URL to every image referenced in the cluster profile. Therefore, if you have
configured an external registry through user data, you no longer need to provide credentials to the private registries
referenced in the profile because those private registries will not be used. You are instead responsible for ensuring
that all images are present in the external registry. For more information, refer to
[Deploy with External Private Registry](./deploy-external-registry.md).

:::

If your have not configured an external registry for your Edge host through the Edge installer configuration user data,
and your cluster profile references private registries, you must provide credentials to those private registries through
[Kubernetes secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) using a manifest in your cluster
profile.

8. Add a new manifest to your cluster profile. For more information, refer to
   [Add a Manifest](../../../../profiles/cluster-profiles/create-cluster-profiles/create-addon-profile/create-manifest-addon.md).

9. In your manifest, provide the following YAML configuration. Replace the placeholders with the correct values
   according to the table below. You need to do this for every private registry referenced and may use dividers `---` to
   separate the secrets .

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   data:
     password: <base64-encdoded-password>
     url: <base64-encoded-url>
     username: <base64-encoded-username>
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     labels:
       spectrocloud.com/registry: "true"
       spectrocloud.com/copyToTarget: "true"
     name: <registry-name>
   type: Opaque
   ```

   | Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
   | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `data.url`      | The URL of the registry in base-64 encoded format. For image registries, this includes only the hostname. For example, `aHR0cHM6Ly9kb2NrZXIuaW8=` for `docker.io`. For helm registries, include both scheme and hostname. For example, `https://blr-artifactory.apps.beehive.net` in based-64 encoded format. |
   | `data.username` | The username used to log in to the registry in base-64 encoded format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
   | `data.password` | The password of the user in base-64 encoded format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
   | `metadata.name` | Optional. A human-readable name you may give the registry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

   The following is an example of a manifest providing the credentials providing credentials to multiple registries,
   including both image registries and helm registries.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   data:
     password: <base64-encdoded-password>
     url: ZWRnZS51cy13ZXN0Mi5hcnRpZmFjdG9yeS5jb20=
     username: dXNlcjE=
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     labels:
       spectrocloud.com/registry: "true"
     name: image-registry1
   type: Opaque
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   data:
     password: <base64-encdoded-password>
     url: aHR0cHM6Ly9lZGdlLnVzLXdlc3QyLmFydGlmYWN0b3J5LmNvbQ==
     username: dXNlcjE=
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     labels:
       spectrocloud.com/registry: "true"
     name: helm-registry1
   type: Opaque
   ```

10. Use the cluster profile to create your Edge cluster. For more information, refer to
    [Create Cluster Definition](../cluster-deployment.md).

### Save Profile and Deploy Cluster

8. Click **Save Changes**.

9. Deploy a new Edge cluster with your updated profile. Or, if you have an active cluster, update the cluster to use the
   new version of the cluster profile. The initial download of the images will require a connection to the external
   network as the images are sourced from the original repository. Subsequent image pulls are sourced from the local
   Harbor registry.

## Validation

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com).

2. From the left **Main Menu**, navigate to **Clusters**. Choose your Edge cluster.

3. Navigate to the **Nodes** tab, in the **Private Ips** column, you can find the IP addresses of your Edge hosts.

4. Ensure you have network access to your Edge hosts. Open a new tab in your browser and navigate to
   `https://NODE_IP:30003` and replace `NODE_IP` with any IP address in your cluster. NodePort-type services are exposed
   on the same port on all nodes in your cluster. If you changed the HTTPS port in the configurations, replace the port
   with the HTTPS port you used.

5. If you didn't provide a certificate or used a self-signed certificate, your browser might warn you about an unsafe
   connection. Dismiss the warning, and you will be directed to Harbor's web UI. If you are using Google Chrome, you can
   click anywhere in your browser tab and type `thisisunsafe` using your keyboard to dismiss the warning.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

6. Type in your credentials to log in to Harbor. The username is always `admin`. The password is what you configured
   during cluster creation. If you don't know your password, refer to <VersionedLink text="Retrieve Harbor Credentials" url="/integrations/packs/?pack=harbor-edge-native-config#retrieve-harbor-credentials"/> to retrieve your
   password.

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

7. In the **Projects** view, select the **spectro-images** project.

8. Confirm that all images required by the cluster are stored in the project.
