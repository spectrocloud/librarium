Edge environments are inherently diverse, especially when it comes to networking conditions. Often, the network your
Edge devices are deployed in are outside of your control, and you do not have on-site technical staff to troubleshoot
when things go wrong. Therefore, it's important to ensure that your Edge deployments can accommodate various networking
conditions and are resilient to accidents and outages.

This section describes solutions offered by Palette Edge to navigate different network environments at the edge to
ensure that you can keep your Edge clusters and their services operational and available.
