Once you have built the Edge Installer ISO and the provider image, you can proceed to installation and Day-2 operations
such as upgrading a cluster thereafter. Both the installation process and the upgrade process for Palette Edge with
Trusted Boot are similar to those without Trusted Boot.

This section discusses how to install Palette Edge with Trusted Boot and how to upgrade a cluster.
