Once you have built the Edge Installer ISO and have pushed the provider image to an available registry, you can proceed
to installation and Day-2 operations such as upgrading a cluster thereafter. Both the installation process and the
upgrade process for Palette Edge with Trusted Boot are similar to those without Trusted Boot.

This section discusses how to install Palette Edge with Trusted Boot and how to upgrade a cluster.
