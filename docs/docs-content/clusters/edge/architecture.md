The following are architectural highlights of Palette-provisioned Edge native clusters.

- Kubernetes is natively installed on the host.

- Support for bare metal and virtualized edge devices.

- Customizable site properties such as network proxies and certificates.

- Configurable Kubernetes API servers to work with virtual IP address (VIP) or Dynamic DNS.

- Edge artifacts hardened according to
  [Center for Internet Security (CIS) standards](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks).

- Edge supports adding multiple devices to the site to form a multi-node Kubernetes cluster.

- Operating system (OS) images are derived from immutable container-based OS images provided by the
  [Kairos](http://kairos.io) open source project.

- The installation is bootstrapped using a relatively small distribution-agnostic _Stylus_ installer image. The
  operating system and Kubernetes version are derived from cluster profile settings associated with the edge site and
  dynamically downloaded and installed.

- Palette Edge Distribution supports use cases that require customizing OS packages, device drivers, and more.

## Minimum Device Requirements

All Edge hosts must meet the following minimum hardware requirements. For specific features, additional hardware
capabilities may be needed. Refer to [Hardware Requirements](./hardware-requirements.md) for details.

## Kubernetes Defaults

The following items are disabled by default for RKE2 and K3s.

- Traefik

- SERVICE-lb

- local-path provisioner

- Flannel

**Example Scenario:**

For the Palette optimized K3s pack, the default network component flannel is disabled to allow the user to independently
use any container network interface pack such as Flannel or others, as part of the network layer of a cluster profile.

The component metrics server is disabled to avoid duplicating it because Palette installs the metrics server by default.

```yaml
cluster:
  config:
    # disable the built in cni
    flannel-backend: none
    no-flannel: true
    disable-network-policy: true
    Disable:
      - metrics-server
```
