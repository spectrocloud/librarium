The EdgeForge configurator is a lightweight and standalone configuration tool for EdgeForge. It allows you to build,
save, edit, and manage the two configuration files that are essential to the EdgeForge process fast with no potential
for syntax errors. EdgeForge Configurator also provides additive preset options that helps you produce boilerplate
configuration files without specifying values for each available field.
