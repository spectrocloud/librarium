The EdgeForge Studio is a lightweight and standalone configuration tool for EdgeForge. It allows you to build, save,
edit, and manage the two configuration files that are essential to the EdgeForge process fast with no potential for
syntax errors. EdgeForge Studio also provides additive preset options that helps you produce boilerplate configuration
files without specifying values for each available field.
