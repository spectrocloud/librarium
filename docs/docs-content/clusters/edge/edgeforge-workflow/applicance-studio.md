Appliance Studio is a lightweight and standalone configuration Graphic User Interface (GUI) for EdgeForge. It runs
locally on your machine and allows you to build, save, edit, and manage the two configuration files that are essential
to the EdgeForge process fast with zero risk of syntax errors. Appliance Studio also provides additive preset options
that helps you produce boilerplate configuration files without specifying values for each available field.
