Appliance Studio is a lightweight and standalone configuration Graphic User Interface (GUI) for EdgeForge. It runs
locally on your machine and allows you to build, save, edit, and manage the two configuration files that are essential
to the EdgeForge process fast with zero risk of syntax errors. It also allows you to create presets, which are templates
that you can reuse to create new configuration files.
