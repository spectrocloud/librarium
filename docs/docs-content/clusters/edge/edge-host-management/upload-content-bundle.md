You can build a content bundle and upload it to an Edge host through the Edge Management Console. The content you upload
can include images, helm charts, and packs. This allows you to provision clusters locally using the content you upload
to the Edge host even when the host does not have a connection to a central Palette instance or an image repository.

This page guides you through how to build a content bundle and upload it to an Edge host using the Edge management
console.
