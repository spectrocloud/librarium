Once Palette Edge has been installed on the Edge host and the Edge host has gone through initial configuration, you will
be able to access the Edge Management Console (EMC). EMC allows you to manage Edge hosts in your network locally, upload
content bundles containing images, helm charts, and and packs, and create Edge clusters locally in disconnected
environments without connections to a central Palette instance.

:::

EMC is designed for Edge deployment in disconnected environments. A disconnected environment means that the Edge host
does not have a connection to a central Palette instance. EMC's functionalities are not available if your cluster has a
connection to a central Palette instance.

Refer to the follow resources to learn how to use EMC to manage your disconnected Edge deployment:
