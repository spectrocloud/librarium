Once Palette Edge has been installed on the Edge host and the Edge host has gone through initial configuration, you will
be able to access the Edge Management Console (EMC). The EMC allows you to manage Edge hosts in your network locally,
upload content such as images and packs, and create Edge clusters without connections to a centralized Palette
installation.
