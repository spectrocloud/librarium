Once Palette Edge has been installed on the Edge host and the Edge host has gone through initial configuration, you will
be able to access Local UI. Local UI allows you to manage Edge hosts in your network locally, upload content bundles
containing images, Helm charts, and packs, and create Edge clusters locally in disconnected environments without
connections to a Palette instance.

:::warning

Local UI only works for Edge deployments in disconnected environments. A disconnected environment means that the Edge
host does not have a connection to a Palette instance. Do not use Local UI if your cluster has a connection to a Palette
instance.

Refer to the follow resources to learn how to use Local UI to manage your disconnected Edge deployment:

## Get Started

- Refer to [Access Local UI](./host-management/access-console.md) for guidance on how to access Local UI and update your
  credentials.

- If you already included a content bundle and a cluster definition in your installer ISO, you can create a cluster
  using the resources in the ISO directly. Refer to [Create Local Cluster](./cluster-management/create-cluster.md) for
  guidance. Refer to [EdgeForge Workflow](../edgeforge-workflow/edgeforge-workflow.md) for guidance on how to include
  content bundles and cluster definitions in your ISO.

- If you did not provide a content bundle or cluster definition, or if you want to provide new content from which to
  build clusters, refer to the following guides to upload content bundles and export cluster definitions.

  - [Upload Content Bundles](./cluster-management/upload-content-bundle.md)

  - [Export Cluster Definition](./cluster-management/export-cluster-definition.md)
