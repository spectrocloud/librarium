Edge clusters without connections to a Palette installation.

This page guides you through how access the console, and log in, and manage your username and password.

## Log in to Local UI

### Prerequisites

- An Edge host installed with Edge Installer 4.3 or later.

- The Edge host does not have a connection to a Palette instance and the installation is conducted with the
  `installationMode` parameter set to `airgap`. For more information, refer to
  [Installer Configuration](../../edge-configuration/installer-reference.md).

- You have completed or skipped the initial configuration of the Edge host. For more information, refer to
  [Edge Host Initial Configuration](../../site-deployment/site-installation/initial-setup.md).

- Network access to the Edge host's port where Local UI is exposed. The default port is 5080.

- Credentials to log in to Local UI. Any OS user can be used to log into Local UI.

### Instructions

1. Ensure the Edge host is powered on.

2. In your browser, go to `https://HOST_IP:5080`. Replace `HOST_IP` with the IP address of your Edge host. If you have
   access to the Edge host terminal, the address of Local UI console is displayed on the terminal screen. If you have
   changed the default port of the console, replace `5080` with the Local UI port.

3. You will be prompted to log in. Enter your username and password to log in.
