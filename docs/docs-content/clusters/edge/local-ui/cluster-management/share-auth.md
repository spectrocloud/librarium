In order to access Local UI, you need to authenticate yourself. Local UI will store a JSON Web Token (JWT) as a cookie
in your browser once authentication is successful, and you won't need to log in again as long as the token exists and
remains valid. If you have applications in your cluster that also require authentication, you can have your application
consume the same token for to streamline the authentication process for your users.
