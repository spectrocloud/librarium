Local UI allows you to upload content bundles to the Edge host. The content in the content bundles can then be used
during cluster creation. You can also import cluster definitions, which is a bundle of one or more cluster profiles and
their profile variables, from Palette to define your Edge cluster. If you have multiple hosts that are linked to each
other, you can create multi-node clusters consisting of the linked hosts.

Cluster operations in Local UI are only available to airgapped Edge hosts. You cannot use Local UI to create or manage
clusters, upload content bundles, or cluster definition on a connected Edge host. You must use Palette to manage the
cluster instead. For more information, refer to
[Create Cluster Definition](../../site-deployment/cluster-deployment.md).
