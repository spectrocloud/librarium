Local UI allows you to upload content bundles to the Edge host. The content in the content bundles can then be used to
create a single-node cluster consisting of the Edge host itself. You can also import cluster definitions, which is a
bundle of one or more cluster profiles and their profile variables, from Palette to define your Edge cluster.
