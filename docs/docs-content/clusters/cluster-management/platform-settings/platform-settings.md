Palette provides two platform settings:

* **Pause Agent Upgrades** excludes a cluster or group of clusters from being upgraded once Palette upgrades.

* **Cluster Auto Remediation** controls whether unhealthy nodes in Palette-provisioned clusters will automatically be replaced with new nodes.

These settings can be enabled at different scopes.
