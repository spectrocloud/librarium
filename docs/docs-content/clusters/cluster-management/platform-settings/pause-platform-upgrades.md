Palette supports the **Pause Agent Upgrades** feature to exclude a cluster or a group of clusters from having their
Palette agent automatically upgraded when Palette is upgraded.

:::info

This feature only pauses upgrades for Palette agents, not updates to the clusters themselves.

:::

## Pause Agent Upgrade Scopes

Agent upgrades can be paused and resumed in the following scopes:

- Pause agent upgrades for a single cluster
- Pause agent upgrades for all clusters within a project
- Pause agent upgrades for all clusters within a tenant

When determining if the agent upgrades for one cluster is paused or not, you only need to look at the setting for the
cluster itself. Agent upgrade settings are always applied based on individual cluster settings. Project and tenant agent
upgrade settings are not inherited - instead cluster level settings are set to match _each time_ project and tenant
level settings are changed.

Pausing or resuming agent upgrades at a higher-level scope will automatically pause or resume agent upgrades in the
lower-level scopes. For example, if you pause agent upgrades at the tenant level, then agent upgrades will be paused for
all projects within that tenant, and all clusters within those projects. Similarly, if you resume upgrades at the
project level, then all clusters within that project will have their agent upgrades resumed.

This is a one-time change that happens at the moment when you pause or resume upgrades in the project or tenant scope,
and it does not mandate that the same setting be kept at the lower scopes. If you pause or resume agent upgrades in a
lower-level scope, it will override the setting from the higher-level scope. For example, even if all agent upgrades are
paused at the tenant level, you can override the tenant-level pause by resuming upgrades in a specific project or a
specific cluster.

:::warning

Overrides of agent upgrade settings are not permanent. When the pause agent settings at the project or tenant scope
change, the agent upgrade setting in the cluster or project scopes will always be set to match the higher-level scope
setting regardless. If you want to override the project or tenant level agent upgrade setting, you must change the agent
upgrade setting in the lower scope _after_ the change in the higher scope.

:::

The following table lists some example upgrade configurations and whether the Palette agent will be upgrades in those
settings. Note that only the settings at the cluster level determines whether the Palette agent will be upgraded.

| Tenant           | Project          | Cluster          | Outcome                                   |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Upgrades paused  | Upgrades paused  | Upgrades enabled | Palette agent will upgrade automatically. |
| Upgrades enabled | Upgrades enabled | Upgrade paused   | Palette agent upgrades are paused.        |

## Agent Upgrades for PCG and Edge Hosts

Aside from clusters, you can also pause the agent upgrades on Private Cloud Gateways (PCG) and Edge hosts that are
registered with Palette but are not part of a cluster.

Since PCGs are scoped to tenants, you can pause the agent upgrades on a PCG by pausing agent upgrades on the tenant to
which the PCG is associated. You can also pause or resume upgrades for a PCG in the PCG details page through **Cluster
Settings**. Similar to clusters, pausing and resuming upgrades at the tenant level will pause or resume agent upgrades
for all PCGs in the tenant. Pausing and resuming upgrades for a PCG individually will override the tenant-level setting.

Edge hosts that are part of a cluster have their agent upgrades managed by the settings of their cluster. Edge hosts
that are not part of a cluster have their agent upgrades managed at the project and tenant level. Similar to clusters,
pausing or resuming agent upgrades at the tenant level will automatically pause or resume agent upgrades for all
projects within that tenant. However, you can override the tenant level setting by manually changing the upgrade setting
at the project level.

The following is a table showing the scopes at which you can pause agent upgrades for different objects. The same
relationship between the scopes applies: Changing the setting in a higher scope will trigger a one-time change to the
lower scopes, and changing the setting at the lower scope will override the setting in the higher scope.

|                 | Individual Cluster/PCG | Project | Tenant |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ------- | ------ |
| Cluster         | ✅                     | ✅      | ✅     |
| PCG             | ✅                     | ❌      | ✅     |
| Idle Edge hosts | ❌                     | ✅      | ✅     |
