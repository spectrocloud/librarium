The [Kubernetes Dashboard](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard) is a general-purpose, web-based UI for Kubernetes
clusters. You can use the dashboard to manage the cluster, deploy and manage applications, and troubleshoot issues.

Use the [Spectro Kubernetes Dashboard](../../integrations/spectro-k8s-dashboard.md) pack to add the Kubernetes dashboard
to your cluster. The pack documentation page has instructions on how to use the pack.
