# Overview

The [Kubernetes Dashboard](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard) is a general-purpose, web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters. You can use the dashboard to manage the cluster, deploy and manage applications, and troubleshoot issues. 

Use the [Spectro Kubernetes Dashboard](/integrations/spectro-k8s-dashboard) pack to add the Kubernetes dashboard to your cluster. The pack documentation page has instructions on how to use the pack.
