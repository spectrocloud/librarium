Palette exposes a set of [workload metrics](../workloads.md) out-of-the-box to help cluster administrators better
understand the resource utilization of the cluster. The workload metrics Palette exposes are a snapshot in time and
offer a limited ability to review past values. Administrators who want more information or a better understanding of
their cluster metrics should consider using a dedicated monitoring system.

Several Packs are available in the [monitoring](../../../integrations/integrations.mdx) category that you can use to add
additional monitoring capabilities to your cluster and help you get answers to questions. For a more robust and scalable
solution, we recommend creating a dedicated monitoring stack for your environment. You can deploy a monitoring stack
that uses [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) to collect metrics from all clusters in your environment.

To help you get started with deploying a monitoring stack to your Palette environment, check out the
[Deploy Monitoring Stack](deploy-monitor-stack.md) and the [Enable Monitoring on Host Cluster](deploy-agent.md) guide.
