Palette exposes a set of [workload metrics](/clusters/cluster-management/workloads) out-of-the-box to help cluster administrators better understand the resource utilization of the cluster. The workload metrics Palette exposes are a snapshot in time and offer a limited ability to review past values. Administrators who want more information or a better understanding of their cluster metrics should consider using a dedicated monitoring system.

Several Packs are available in the [monitoring](/integrations) category that you can use to add additional monitoring capabilities to your cluster and help you get answers to questions. For a more robust and scalable solution, we recommend creating a dedicated monitoring stack for your environment. You can deploy a monitoring stack that uses [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) to collect metrics from all clusters in your environment. 

To help you get started with deploying a monitoring stack to your Palette environment, check out the [Deploy Monitoring Stack](/clusters/cluster-management/monitoring/deploy-monitor-stack) and the [Enable Monitoring on Host Cluster](/clusters/cluster-management/monitoring/deploy-agent) guide.
