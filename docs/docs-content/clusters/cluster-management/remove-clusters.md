When you delete a cluster it results in the removal of all compute instances and associated resources created for the cluster. Use the following steps to delete a cluster. 

### Prerequisites

* A host cluster.



## Removal

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com) and ensure you are in the correct project scope.


2. Navigate to the left **Main Menu** and click on **Clusters**.


3. Click on the cluster you want to delete.


4. Click on the **Settings drop-down Menu**.


5. Click on **Delete Cluster**.


6. Type the cluster name and click on **OK**.

The cluster status is updated to **Deleting** while cluster resources are removed. When all resources are successfully deleted, the cluster status is updated to **Deleted**, and the cluster is removed from the cluster list.


## Validate

To validate the host cluster is deleted, use the following steps.

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com).


2. Navigate to the left **Main Menu** and click on **Cluster**.


4. Check the box labeled **Deleted only** to view all the clusters deleted in the last 72 hours.

The cluster you deleted is now listed along with other previously deleted clusters.



## Force Delete a Cluster

If a cluster is stuck in the **Deleting** state for a minimum of 15 minutes, it becomes eligible for force deletion. You can force delete a cluster from the tenant and project admin scope.

To force delete a cluster, follow the same steps outlined above. After 15 minutes, a **Force Delete Cluster** option is available in the **Settings drop-down Menu**. The drop-down menu will provide you with an estimated remaining time left before the force deletion becomes available.

<br />


A force delete can result in Palette-provisioned resources being missed in the removal process. Verify there are no remaining resources. Use the following list to help you identify resources to remove.

Failure in removing provisioned resources can result in unexpected costs.
