Palette monitors the health of all Workload Clusters and raises an alert when the Cluster goes to an unhealthy state.
Besides displaying the alert on the User Interface (UI) console, Palette provides the ability to have these alerts
pushed out to a variety of channels. Users can set up simple email alerts to receive a notice when the Health Status of
their cluster changes. Additionally, they can set up Webhooks to integrate alerts with a variety of IT Service
Management (ITSM) tools such as ServiceNow, Slack, or Microsoft Teams. These alerts are set up at the Project level and
apply to all Clusters within the Project.

The Palette Management Server relies on the following to trigger Cluster-health Alerts:

- Node and resource metrics pushed by Spectro agent from clusters.

- Machines' info and heartbeat from the agent.

  Management server has a timeout of 10 mins for heartbeat detection. An alert is triggered if agent heartbeat is not
  received within the fixed timeout. Cluster will be marked as "unhealthy" when the agent is down/paused for
  troubleshooting. This behavior is applicable for:

  - Both workload clusters and management cluster of public cloud.
  - Management clusters of on-premises, enterprise infrastructure.
