Palette deploys Kubernetes clusters using pre-built VM images. The operating system (OS) on these images is the latest
patch version when building the image for the supported major-minor streams. For example, if Ubuntu 18.04 is selected
for the OS layer during provisioning, the OS on the cluster nodes might be using 18.04.3 LTE, assuming that was the
latest version available at the time the VM image was built. However, newer versions continue to be published in the
upstream repositories as improvements, bug fixes, and security patches are released.

OS Patching allows the operating system on the running cluster nodes to be updated to the latest patch version so that
it is up-to-date with the latest fixes. Assume Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTE and 18.04.5 LTE are released over time to fix
important security issues. The OS Patching operation will identify 18.04.5 as the latest version and upgrade it on the
cluster nodes.

The following options are available for OS patching:

- [Patch OS on boot](#patch-os-on-boot)
- [Enable scheduled patching](#enable-scheduled-patching)
- [Patch OS on-demand](#perform-on-demand-patching)

You can use a combination of these options to patch the operating system to the latest version. For example, you can
patch OS on boot, set up scheduled patching every month, and also perform on-demand patches at any given point in time.

Palette offers the option to provide custom node drain configuration, which gives you fine-grained control of drain
behaviour during updates. Refer to the [Configure OS Patching Drain Policy](#configure-os-patching-drain-policy) for
further information.

## Patch OS on Boot

During the cluster creation, while configuring the cluster, you can select **Patch OS on boot**. In this case, the
operating system on all cluster nodes will be updated to the latest when the cluster VMs are initially deployed.

### Prerequisites

- A cluster profile in Palette.

### Instructions

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com).

2. From the left **Main Menu**, click **Cluster**. And then, click **Create Cluster**. Proceed in the cluster creation
   wizard until you reach the **Settings** step.

   For more information on cluster creation, refer to the [Clusters](../clusters.md) section and any page that is
   relevant to your choice of cloud provider.

3. In the **Setting** step, click on the **Manage machines** tab, and select the checkbox for **Patch OS on boot** and
   **Reboot if required**.

   The **Reboot if required** option allows your nodes to reboot if an OS patch requires a reboot. If you do not select
   this option, your node will not be able to reboot even if a patch requires it and the respective patch may not
   succeed.

4. Finish cluster creation and deploy your cluster.

### Validate

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com).

2. Click on the cluster you patched to view cluster details.

3. Click on the **Nodes** tab of the cluster details page. You can find the current OS version and when the most recent
   patch was applied.

   | **Field**               | **Description**                         |
   | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
   | Last Applied Patch Time | The date and time of the last OS patch. |
   | Patched Version         | The latest patched version.             |

## Enable Scheduled Patching

Palette also supports OS patching through a schedule. The patching schedule can be set initially when creating a cluster
and at any given point later.

### Prerequisites

## Perform On-Demand Patching

You can request an on-demand OS patch after creating a cluster. This option allows you to you to perform immediate
updates.

### Limitations

- This operation is not available for existing Kubernetes clusters imported into Palette.
- This operation is not available for managed Kubernetes Services such as EKS and AKS.
  - For EKS clusters, you can trigger OS updates from Palette. This would request AWS to update cluster node groups to
    the latest patch version.

### Prerequisites

- An active cluster in Palette.

### Enablement

## Configure OS Patching Drain Policy

The node drain operation refers to the process of evicting all of your pods from a node before you perform node
maintenance. Typical node maintenance activities are hardware upgrades, kernel updates and OS patching. Palette provides
the ability to configure the drain policy during on-boot, scheduled, and on-demand OS patching. Users can specify a node
drain policy using a ConfigMap, which can be applied to deployed clusters using a cluster profile or through `kubectl`.

### Limitations

- This operation is not available for existing Kubernetes clusters that have been previously imported into Palette.
- This operation is not available for managed Kubernetes Services such as EKS and AKS.
  - For EKS clusters, you can trigger OS updates from Palette. This would request AWS to update cluster node groups to
    the latest patch version.

### Prerequisites

- An active cluster in Palette.

### Enablement

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com).

2. From the left **Main Menu**, click **Profiles**. Then, click **Add Cluster Profile**. The cluster profile creation
   wizard appears.

3. Fill in a name in the **Name** field. Optionally, add a description in the **Description** field. Select the

   You can also specify the drain policy ConfigMap directly on the cluster by using `kubectl`. Download the
   [Kubeconfig](./kubeconfig.md) file to connect to the cluster and issue the
   `kubectl create configmap palette-agent-config --namespace <cluster-id>` command. Then, execute the command
   `kubectl edit configmap palette-agent-config --namespace <cluster-id>` command and paste the configuration provided.
