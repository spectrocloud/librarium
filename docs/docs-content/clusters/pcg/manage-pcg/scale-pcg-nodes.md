You can increase the number of nodes of a Private Cloud Gateway (PCG). This is useful when you want to convert a
single-node PCG to a multi-node PCG to provide additional capacity or to meet the requirements of your workloads.

:::warning

You cannot scale down the number of nodes in a PCG. If you want to reduce the number of PCG nodes, then you must delete
the PCG and deploy a new one with the desired number of nodes. This limitation is due to the etcd not supporting
scale-down operations.

:::

Use the following steps to increase the number of nodes in a PCG.

## Prerequisites

- A PCG is installed, active, and in a healthy state. Refer to [Deploy a PCG](../deploy-pcg/deploy-pcg.md) for
  instructions on how to install a PCG.

- The PCG is a single-node deployment.

- The PCG was deployed through the Palette CLI. A PCG hosted on an existing Kubernetes cluster cannot be scaled up by
  Palette.

- Three additional IP addresses are available for the new nodes.

- Tenant administrator access.

## Increase Node Count

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com) as a tenant administrator.

2. Navigate to the left **Main Menu** and select **Tenant Settings**.

3. Select **Private Cloud Gateways** from the **Tenant Settings Menu**.

4. Identify the PCG you want to modify and click on the **Three-Dot Menu** at the end of the PCG row.

5. Select **Set number of nodes**.

6. Click on the radio button to select the number of nodes you want to set for the PCG.

7. Click **Confirm** to apply the changes.

8. From the PCG list view, click on the PCG to access the PCG details page. From the PCG details page, click on the
   **Nodes** tab to view the status of the nodes.

Additional nodes are added sequentially to the PCG. The status of the nodes will change from **Provisioning Node** to
**Running** once the provisioning process is complete.

## Validate

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com) as a tenant administrator.

2. Navigate to the left **Main Menu** and select **Tenant Settings**.

3. Select **Private Cloud Gateways** from the **Tenant Settings Menu**.

4. Click on the PCG to access the PCG details page.

5. From the PCG details page, click on the **Nodes** tab to view the status of the nodes.

6. Verify that the number of nodes has been increased and that the status of the new nodes is **Running**.
