You can add and manage proxy configurations for a Private Cloud Gateway (PCG) deployed into an existing Kubernetes
cluster. By default, a PCG deployed to an existing Kubernetes cluster does not have a proxy configuration. If your
infrastructure environment requires a proxy configuration, use the instructions in this guide to add and manage proxy
configurations for a PCG deployed in a Kubernetes cluster and to ensure workload clusters deployed through Palette
inherit the proxy configuration from the PCG cluster.

:::info

Workload clusters deployed through Palette will inherit proxy configuration from the PCG cluster. The PCG is not used as
a network proxy for deployed workload clusters and does not provide internet connectivity for the workload clusters.
Individual workload clusters must have their own proxy configurations to access the internet.

:::

Use the following steps to add and manage proxy configurations for a PCG.

## Prerequisites

- A PCG is deployed into an active and healthy Kubernetes cluster. Refer to
  [Deploy a PCG to an Existing Kubernetes Cluster](../deploy-pcg-k8s.md) for additional guidance.

  :::warning

  If you deployed a [PCG through the Palette CLI](../pcg.md#supported-environments), refer to the respective platform
  installation guide for instructions on how to configure proxy settings during the installation process through the
  CLI.

  :::

- The kubeconfig file for the Kubernetes cluster where the PCG is deployed. The Kubconfig file is used to authenticate
  with the Kubernetes cluster and deploy the Reach service.

- Admin access to the Kubernetes cluster where the PCG is deployed. The Reach Helm Chart will create a namespace,
  service accounts, and roles in the cluster.

- The extract utilities `zip` and `tar` are installed in the system you are using to deploy the Helm chart.

- Palette tenant administrator access.

- Proxy configuration details, such as the proxy URL, port, and authentication credentials.

- The deployed PCG must have network connectivity to the proxy server.

- The Kubernetes cluster where the PCG is deployed must have the proxy configuration. This includes any Certificate
  Authority (CA) certificates that are required to authenticate with the proxy server. This step varies depending on the
  platform where the Kubernetes cluster is deployed. Some platforms, such as managed Kubernetes services, may require
  additional steps. Below is a list of helpful links to set up proxy configurations for some common Kubernetes
  platforms:

  - [Amazon EKS](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/eks-http-proxy-containerd-automation)
  - [Azure AKS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/http-proxy)
  - [vSphere](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-vcenter-configuration/GUID-7576FBBE-8B67-4D3F-B859-C9688E9442D7.html)

    :::warning

    This feature has only been tested on AWS, Azure, and VMware vSphere. If you are using a different cloud provider,
    contact our support team for additional guidance.

    :::

- Download the Reach Helm Chart provided by our support team. The Reach Helm Chart is used to deploy the Reach service
  into the Kubernetes cluster where the PCG is deployed. The Reach service is used to manage proxy configurations for
  the PCG. Contact our support team to obtain the Reach Helm Chart.

- `cert-manager` is not already deployed in the Kubernetes cluster where the PCG is deployed. The reason for this is
  that you will deploy `cert-manager` as part of the enablement steps.

  :::info

  If `cert-manager` is already deployed, you can continue to use the service but make sure you edit the deployment to
  use the `- --feature-gates=AdditionalCertificateOutputFormats=true` flag. Otherwise, the Reach service cannot manage
  the proxy configurations.

  :::

## Enable Proxy

1. Open a terminal session and navigate to the folder where you downloaded the Reach Helm Chart zip file.

2. Unzip the zip file you received from the support team.

   ```shell
   unzip release-*.zip -d palette
   ```

3. Navigate to the release folder.

   ```shell
   cd palette/charts/release-*/
   ```

4. Deploy `cert-manager` to the Kubernetes cluster where the PCG is deployed. Use the following command to deploy the
   `cert-manager` Helm Chart.

   ```shell
   helm upgrade --values extras/cert-manager/values.yaml \
   cert-manager extras/cert-manager/cert-manager-*.tgz --install
   ```

5. Next, navigate to the reach-system folder and extract the Reach Helm Chart.

   ```shell
   cd extras/reach-system/ && tar -xvzf reach-system-*.tgz
   ```

6. Open the **reach-system/values.yaml** file in a text editor. Fill out the following YAML fields with the proxy
   configuration details:

   | Field Name                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |
   | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | `reachSystem.enabled`                   | Set this field to `true` to enable the Reach service.                                                                                                                                      |
   | `reachSystem.proxySettings.http_proxy`  | The HTTP proxy URL, including the port number.                                                                                                                                             |
   | `reachSystem.proxySettings.https_proxy` | The HTTPS proxy URL, including the port number.                                                                                                                                            |
   | `reachSystem.proxySettings.no_proxy`    | A comma-separated list of URLs that should bypass the proxy.                                                                                                                               |
   | `reachSystem.proxySettings.ca_crt_path` | The path to the CA certificate file used to authenticate the proxy server. Make sure the CA certificate is in the PEM format. If you do not have a CA certificate, leave this field empty. |

   <br />

   :::info

   A note on the `no_proxy` field: The `no_proxy` field is a comma-separated list of URLs that should bypass the proxy.
   Depending on your environment, you may need to add additional URLs to this list. The list provided in the code
   snippet below is a generic list that should work for most environments. The IP address `169.254.169.254,` is required
   to be added to the `no_proxy` list. Otherwise, pods will not be able to start up successfully.

   ```

   ```

   :::

   The following is an example of a filled-out **values.yaml** file.

   ```yaml hideClipboard
   reachSystem:
     enabled: true
     proxySettings:
       http_proxy: "http://172.16.0.4:1080"
       https_proxy: "https://172.16.0.4:1080"
       no_proxy: ".aks.io,.amazonaws.com,.azure.com,.capz.io,.cluster.local,.gcr.io,.hubble-system,.kube-system,.kvdb,.microsoftonline.com,.privatelink.eastus.azmk8s.io,.spectrocloud.com,.spectrocloud.dev,.svc,.windows.net,10.0.0.0/8,10.10.128.10,10.10.192.1/18,10.96.0.0/12,127.0.0.1,169.254.169.254,.privatelink.eastus.azmk8s.io,.azure.com,.aks.io,.capz.io,.spectrocloud.com,gcr.io,windows.net,.windows.net,.microsoftonline.com,.amazonaws.com,.gcr.io,192.168.0.0/16,gcr.io,kubernetes,localhost,portworx-service,prometheus-operator-prometheus,windows.net"
       ca_crt_path: "proxy-ca-cert.pem"
   ```

7. Save the **values.yaml** file.

8. Deploy the Reach service into the Kubernetes cluster where the PCG is deployed using the Reach Helm Chart. Use the
   following command to deploy the Reach service.

   ```shell
   helm upgrade --values reach-system/values.yaml reach-system reach-system-*.tgz --install
   ```

   ```shell hideClipboard
   WARNING: Kubernetes configuration file is group-readable. This is insecure. Location: /Users/ubuntu/.kube/config
   WARNING: Kubernetes configuration file is world-readable. This is insecure. Location: /Users/ubuntu/.kube/config
   Release "reach-system" does not exist. Installing it now.
   NAME: reach-system
   LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Jul 15 15:17:58 2024
   NAMESPACE: default
   STATUS: deployed
   REVISION: 1
   TEST SUITE: None
   ```

Once the Reach service is deployed, the PCG will use the proxy configuration in the Reach Helm Chart. If the cloud
account is configured to use the PCG, the proxy configuration will be inherited by the workload clusters deployed
through Palette.

## Validate

Use the following steps to validate that the Reach service is deployed and that the proxy configuration is enabled for
the PCG.

1. Open a terminal session.

2. Issue the following command against the Kubernetes cluster where the PCG is deployed. Verify that the pods are active
   and healthy.

   ```shell
   kubectl get pods --namespace reach-system
   ```

   The output should display the Reach service pods in the **Running** status.

   ```shell hideClipboard
   NAME                                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   reach-controller-manager-995c74db5-frb5j            2/2     Running   0          2m
   ```

3. After configuring your cloud account to use the PCG, you can verify that the deployed workload clusters inherit the
   proxy configuration from the PCG. To verify the proxy configuration is inherited by the workload clusters, deploy a
   workload cluster through Palette. SSH into a node in the workload cluster and issue the following command to verify
   the proxy configuration is inherited.

   ```shell
   cat /etc/systemd/system/containerd.service.d/http-proxy.conf
   ```

   The output will display the proxy configuration details. Below is an example of the output.

   ```shell hideClipboard
   [Service]
   Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://172.16.0.4:1080"
   Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=https://172.16.0.4:1080"
   Environment="NO_PROXY=.aks.io,.amazonaws.com,.azure.com,.capz.io,.cluster.local,.gcr.io,.hubble-system,.kube-system,.kvdb,.microsoftonline.com,.privatelink.eastus.azmk8s.io,.spectrocloud.com,.spectrocloud.dev,.svc,.windows.net,10.0.0.0/8,10.10.128.10,10.10.192.1/18,10.96.0.0/12,127.0.0.1,169.254.169.254,.privatelink.eastus.azmk8s.io,.azure.com,.aks.io,.capz.io,.spectrocloud.com,gcr.io,windows.net,.windows.net,.microsoftonline.com,.amazonaws.com,.gcr.io,192.168.0.0/16,gcr.io,kubernetes,localhost,portworx-service,prometheus-operator-prometheus,windows.net"
