This guide provides you with the steps to deploy a PCG cluster to a MAAS environment. Before you begin the installation,
carefully review the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

## Prerequisites

- Palette version 4.0.X or greater.

- A Palette API key. Refer to the [Create API Key](../../../user-management/authentication/api-key/create-api-key.md)
  page for guidance.

  :::warning

  The installation does not work with Single Sign-On (SSO) credentials. You must use an API key from a local tenant
  admin account in Palette to deploy the PCG. After the PCG is configured and functioning, this local account is no
  longer used to keep the PCG connected to Palette, so you can deactivate the account if desired.

  :::

- Download and install the Palette CLI from the [Downloads](../../../spectro-downloads.md#palette-cli) page. Refer to
  the [Palette CLI Install](../../../automation/palette-cli/install-palette-cli.md) guide to learn more.

The following system requirements must be met to install a PCG in MAAS:

- PCG IP address requirements:

  - One IP address for a single-node PCG or three IP addresses for a three-node PCG. Refer to the
    [PCG Sizing](./deploy-pcg.md#pcg-sizing) section for more information on sizing.
  - One IP address for the Kubernetes control-plane.
  - DNS can resolve the domain `api.spectrocloud.com`.

- An x86 Linux environment with a Docker daemon installed and a connection to Palette and the MAAS endpoint. The Palette
  CLI installation must be invoked on an up-to-date Linux system with the x86-64 architecture.

- PCG IP address requirements:

  - For a single-node gateway, one IP address must be available in the MAAS subnet for the PCG, or three available IP
    addresses for a three-node gateway.
  - One IP address must be available in the MAAS subnet for the Kubernetes API-server endpoint when deploying a
    three-node gateway.
  - One IP address reserved for cluster repave operations.
  - One IP address for the Virtual IP (VIP).

- Sufficient IP range available within the configured MAAS subnets.

  :::warning

  By default, the MAAS Kubernetes pack uses a pod Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) range of 192.168.0.0/16. Ensure
  that the pod CIDR range for any clusters you deploy after setting up the PCG does not overlap with the network used by
  the bare metal machines that MAAS manages.

  :::

- Each node in the PCG cluster requires a machine from MAAS in a ready state with the following resources:

  - CPU: 4
  - Memory: 8192 MiB
  - Storage: 60 GiB

  For production environments, we recommend using three nodes, each with 100 GiB of storage, as nodes can exhaust the 60
  GiB storage with prolonged use. If you initially set up the gateway with one node, you can resize it later.

- An active MAAS API key. Refer to the
  [Authenticating to the MAAS API](https://maas.io/docs/api-authentication-reference) guide to learn more about how to
  create an API key.

- The DNS server that the PCG installer will use must be able to resolve the DNS names of machines that MAAS deploys so
  it can connect to them. The default setup is to use the MAAS server as the DNS server for any bare metal servers that
  it deploys. The default MAAS DNS zone is `.maas`. You can use `.maas` or the MAAS web console to create a new DNS
  zone. When you deploy the PCG and clusters, you can select the desired DNS zone in which DNS name records should be
  created.

  In the MAAS subnet configuration, you can specify which DNS servers those servers in the MAAS subnet should use.

  :::warning

  If you configure a DNS server other than the MAAS DNS server, you must create a DNS delegation so that it can forward
  DNS requests for zones that are hosted by MAAS to the MAAS DNS server.

  :::

The installation process first requests machines from MAAS and then must connect to them. To connect, the installation
process attempts to use the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the server. If you used `.maas` as the default DNS
zone, the FQDN would be `machine-hostname.maas`.

The diagram below shows an example of using an external DNS server for servers that MAAS deploys in addition to a DNS
delegation. This ensures all servers in the network can resolve the DNS names of servers deployed by MAAS. Note that it
is not required for the DNS records to be accessible from the internet.

    | :-------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **HTTPS Proxy**                   | Leave this blank unless you are using an HTTPS Proxy. This setting will be propagated to all PCG nodes and all of its cluster nodes. Example: `https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@PROXYIP:PROXYPORT`.                                                                                                                   |
    | **HTTP Proxy**                    | Leave this blank unless you are using an HTTP Proxy. This setting will be propagated to all PCG nodes and all of its cluster nodes. Example: `http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@PROXYIP:PROXYPORT`.                                                                                                                     |
    | **No Proxy**                      | Provide a list of local network CIDR addresses, hostnames, and domain names that should be excluded from being a proxy. This setting will be propagated to all the nodes to bypass the proxy server. Example for a self-hosted environment: `my.company.com,10.10.0.0/16`.                                     |
    | **Proxy CA Certificate Filepath** | The default is blank. You can provide the file path of a CA certificate on the installer host. If provided, this CA certificate will be copied to each host in the PCG cluster during deployment. The provided path will be used on the PCG cluster hosts. Example: `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ca.crt`. |
    | **Pod CIDR**                      | Enter the CIDR pool that will be used to assign IP addresses to pods in the PCG cluster. The pod IP addresses should be unique and not overlap with any machine IPs in the environment.                                                                                                                        |
    | **Service IP Range**              | Enter the IP address range that will be used to assign IP addresses to services in the PCG cluster. The service IP addresses should be unique and not overlap with any machine IPs in the environment.                                                                                                         |

5.  If you selected `Custom` for the image registry type, you will be prompted to provide the following information.

    | **Parameter**                             | **Description**                                                                                       |
    | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **Domain**                                | Select the MAAS domain.                                                                               |
    | **Patch OS on boot**                      | This parameter indicates whether or not to patch the OS of the PCG hosts on the first boot.           |
    | **Reboot nodes once OS patch is applied** | This parameter indicates whether or not to reboot PCG nodes after OS patches are applied.             |
    | **Availability Zone**                     | Select the availability zones for the PCG cluster.                                                    |
    | **Number of Nodes**                       | Select the number of nodes for the PCG cluster. We recommend three nodes for production environments. |
    | **Node Affinity**                         | Select `y` to allow all Palette pods to be scheduled on control plane nodes.                          |

    :::warning

    Ensure the MAAS server has one or more machines in the **Ready** state for the chosen availability zone and resource
    pool combination.

8.  A new PCG configuration file is generated, and its location is displayed on the console. You will receive an output
    similar to the following.

    ```bash hideClipboard
    ==== PCG config saved ====
    Location: :/home/demo/.palette/pcg/pcg-20230706150945/pcg.yaml
    ```

    The Palette CLI will now provision a PCG cluster in your MAAS environment. You can monitor the progress of the PCG
    cluster by navigating to Palette and selecting **Tenant Settings** from the left **Main Menu**. Next, click on
    **Private Cloud Gateways** from the left **Tenant Settings Menu** and select the PCG cluster you just deployed to
    access its details page. From the details page, select the **Events** tab to view the progress of the PCG cluster
    deployment.

    If you encounter issues during the installation, refer to the [PCG Troubleshooting](../../../troubleshooting/pcg.md)
    guide for debugging assistance. If you need additional help, reach out to our
    [Customer Support](https://spectrocloud.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals) team.

    :::warning

    You cannot modify a deployed PCG cluster. If you need to make changes to the PCG cluster, you must first delete the
    cluster and redeploy it. We recommend you save your PCG configuration file for future use. Use the `--config-only`
    flag to save the configuration file without deploying the PCG cluster. Refer to the
    [Generate a Configuration File](../../../automation/palette-cli/commands/pcg.md#generate-a-configuration-file)
    section to learn more. For additional assistance, visit our
    [Customer Support](https://spectrocloud.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals) portal.

## Validate

Once installed, the PCG registers itself with Palette. To verify the PCG is registered, use the following steps.

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com) as a tenant admin.

2. Navigate to the left **Main Menu** and select **Tenant Settings**.

3. From the **Tenant Settings Menu**, click on **Private Cloud Gateways**. Verify your PCG cluster is available from the
   list of PCG clusters displayed and that its **Status** is healthy.

4. Navigate to the left **Tenant Settings Menu** and select **Cloud Accounts**.

5. Verify a new MAAS cloud account is available from the list of cloud accounts displayed.

## Next Steps

After you have successfully deployed the PCG into your MAAS environment, you can now deploy Kubernetes clusters in your
environment through Palette. Check out the
[Create and Manage MAAS Clusters](../../data-center/maas/create-manage-maas-clusters.md) guide to learn how to deploy a
Kubernetes cluster in MAAS that is managed by Palette.
