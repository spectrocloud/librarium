A Pack Registry is a server-side application that stores and serves packs to its clients. These packs are retrieved and
presented as options during the creation of a cluster profile. You can add your own Pack Registry to Palette and use the
packs in your cluster profiles.

To create your own Legacy Pack Registry, you must first stand up a server-side application registry that serves the
packs using the Spectro CLI. Refer to the [Add a Custom Registry](../adding-a-custom-registry.md) resource to learn how
to start a server-side application registry that serves packs.

:::info

We recommend you create an Open Container Initiative (OCI) Pack Registry versus using the Legacy Pack registry. OCI Pack
registries provide you with greater hosting flexibility and allow you to use existing OCI registries you may have in
your environment. Refer to the [OCI Registry](./oci-registry/oci-registry.md) resource to learn more about using OCI
registries in Palette.

## Prerequisites

- You must have a server-side application registry that serves packs using the Spectro CLI. Refer to
  [Add a Custom Registry](../adding-a-custom-registry.md) page to learn how to start a server-side application registry
  that serves packs.

- Tenant admin access to Palette.

   | **Certificate**              | If the registry is using a self-signed certificate or if the server certificate is not signed by a trusted CA, upload the X509 certificate. |

7. Click **Validate** to validate the registry. If the credentials are valid and Palette is able to connect to the
   registry, the registry is added to Palette. Otherwise, an error message is displayed.

:::tip

If you are encountering issues with adding a registry, review the endpoint URL and ensure that it is accessible from
Palette. Verify the credentials and try again. Lastly, if the registry is hosted on a server using a self-signed
certificate, upload the certificate to Palette and skip TLS verification.
