You can add an OCI Zarf registry to Palette and use the Zarf packages in cluster profiles. 


## Prerequisites

- You must have an OCI registry that contains Zarf packages.  

- Credentials to access the OCI registry. Public OCI registries are not supported.

- If the OCI registry is using a self-signed certificate, or a certificate that is not signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA), you will need the certificate to add the registry to Palette. 

- Tenant admin access to Palette.


## Add OCI Zarf Registry

Use the following steps to add an OCI Zarf registry to Palette.

1. Log in to the [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com) as a Tenant administrator.

2. From the left **Main Menu** select **Tenant Settings**.

10. If your OCI registry server is using a self-signed certificate or if the server certificate is not signed by a trusted CA, check the **Insecure Skip TLS Verify** box to skip verifying the x509 certificate, and click **Upload file** to upload the certificate.

11. Click **Confirm** to complete adding the registry.
