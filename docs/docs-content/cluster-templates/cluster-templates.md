:::

Cluster templates are reusable blueprints that define and enforce the desired state and lifecycle of clusters deployed
with Palette or [Palette VerteX](../vertex/vertex.md).

Unlike [cluster profiles](../profiles/cluster-profiles/cluster-profiles.md), which define the cluster's software stack
(including OS, Kubernetes distribution, network, storage, and addâ€‘ons), cluster templates are a higher level abstraction
that define the governance stack. They reference existing cluster profiles and operational
[policies](./create-cluster-template-policies/create-cluster-template-policies.md), such as
[maintenance policies](./create-cluster-template-policies/maintenance-policy.md), and leverage
[cluster profile variables](../profiles/cluster-profiles/create-cluster-profiles/define-profile-variables/define-profile-variables.md)
and [macros](../clusters/cluster-management/macros.md), allowing you to deploy, manage, and scale a synchronized fleet
of clusters with minimal effort, while configuring environment-specific values where needed.

Cluster templates can be created at both the tenant and project scope. Cluster templates do not embed cluster profile
and policy configurations but reference them as objects, allowing you to edit and replace them as needed.

Cluster templates operations can be performed with Terraform, Crossplane, and APIs.

## Cluster Profile Behavior

Cluster templates link to [cluster profiles](../profiles/cluster-profiles/cluster-profiles.md), which remain the
backbone of deploying clusters in Palette. Each cluster template must link to one
[full](../profiles/cluster-profiles/create-cluster-profiles/create-full-profile.md) or
[infrastructure profile](../profiles/cluster-profiles/create-cluster-profiles/create-infrastructure-profile.md) and one
[maintenance policy](./create-cluster-template-policies/maintenance-policy.md). You can reference as many
[add-on profiles](../profiles/cluster-profiles/create-cluster-profiles/create-addon-profile/create-addon-profile.md) as
desired. Only one policy of each type can be linked per cluster template (for example, one maintenance policy).

Once a cluster profile is linked to a cluster template, that version of the cluster profile becomes immutable.

![Linked cluster profile version locked](/cluster-templates_locked-cluster-profile.webp)

To make changes to a linked cluster profile, you must
[create a new version](../profiles/cluster-profiles/modify-cluster-profiles/version-cluster-profile.md) of the cluster
profile and update the version referenced in the cluster template. This ensures that all clusters using the cluster
template have identical software stacks, preventing configuration drift that can naturally occur with inline, on-the-fly
updates, or by using varied cluster profile versions across clusters. Additionally, each cluster can only be attached to
one cluster template at a time, further guarding against drift.

A cluster profile version cannot be linked to a cluster template if that profile version is already being used a cluster
that is not attached to a cluster template.

### Cluster Profile Variables

Since cluster profile versions are immutable once linked to a cluster template,
[cluster profile variables](../profiles/cluster-profiles/create-cluster-profiles/define-profile-variables/define-profile-variables.md)
remain the recommended way to configure environment-specific values per cluster, such as IPs, resource limits, and more.

Much like deploying clusters with individual cluster profiles, variable values are assigned and propagated when you
deploy a cluster using a cluster template. Once the cluster is deployed, the variables appear on the **Variable values**
tab of your cluster template with an **Assignment** status of **Assigned**.

Cluster templates help with the initial propagation of new variable values, but they are not the source of truth for
ongoing variable management across clusters. The source of truth remains the cluster profile and the cluster itself.

For example, if you deploy a cluster with a cluster profile

not to manage their definitions or values. For this reason, you cannot assign new values using cluster templates unless
you attach a new cluster profile version to the cluster template.

When you update the cluster profile version attached to your template, all variables enter a **Pending** state. Upon
referring to your cluster, the banner **Action required: This cluster has a pending variable assignment** is displayed.
Select the link to view the list of cluster **Variable values** attached to your cluster template via cluster profiles.

![Action required banner when viewing a cluster with pending variables](/cluster-templates_action-required.webp)

Until you verify the **New value** for all variables and all variables are in an **Assigned** state, clusters attached
to the template will not update to the latest profile version, regardless of whether you wait until the next maintenance
window or initiate the update using the **Upgrade now** button.

To modify variable values for individual clusters, we recommend
[modifying the value from the active cluster](../profiles/cluster-profiles/create-cluster-profiles/define-profile-variables/modify-cluster-profile-variables.md#modify-profile-variable-values-in-an-active-cluster).

Use the below table to help you determine which workflow to use.

### Cluster Profile vs. Cluster Template Deployment

You can deploy clusters using cluster profiles or cluster templates, which encapsulate cluster profiles. If you plan on
deploying a large number of clusters that you want to use the same software stack with environment-specific values and
ensure the clusters update together, consider using cluster templates.

The following table compares two common cluster scenarios.

| Operation                 | Cluster Profile Workflow                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Cluster Template                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Policy Behavior

Policies are an integral part of cluster templates. While cluster profiles define the infrastructure and software stack
for your clusters, cluster template policies are modular, reusable definitions that define how the cluster operates as
well as its lifecycle. Policies are linked rather than embedded within cluster templates, allowing you to manage
policies independently; this includes updating and swapping them as needed to create a comprehensive governance stack
for your clusters.

Currently, Palette supports [maintenance policies](./create-cluster-template-policies/maintenance-policy.md). Each
cluster template can only be linked to one policy of each type. For example, while you can create multiple maintenance
policies that you can update or swap as needed, only one can be attached to the cluster template at any time. However,
the same policy can be attached to multiple cluster templates.

For more information, refer to our
[Create and Manage Cluster Template Policies](./create-cluster-template-policies/create-cluster-template-policies.md)
guide.

## Limitations

- Cluster templates can be used to deploy new clusters only. Certain Day-2 operations, such as attaching a cluster
  template to an existing cluster and detaching clusters from cluster templates, are not supported at this time.

- Rollbacks are not supported at this time.

## Next Steps

Before you can use clusters templates to deploy clusters, you must first create a cluster template. To create a cluster
template, you must have the following resources created in Palette:

- A [full](../profiles/cluster-profiles/create-cluster-profiles/create-full-profile.md) or
  [infrastructure cluster profile](../profiles/cluster-profiles/create-cluster-profiles/create-infrastructure-profile.md).
  Refer to our [Cluster Profiles](../profiles/cluster-profiles/cluster-profiles.md) guide for a general overview of
  cluster profiles.

- A cluster template [maintenance policy](./create-cluster-template-policies/maintenance-policy.md). Refer to our
  [Cluster Template Policies](./create-cluster-template-policies/create-cluster-template-policies.md) guide for a
  general overview of cluster template policies.

Once you have the following resources, refer to our [Create Cluster Templates](./create-cluster-templates.md) guide to
learn how to create a cluster template and deploy clusters using cluster templates.
