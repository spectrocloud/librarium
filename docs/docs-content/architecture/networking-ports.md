Palette communicates with workload clusters using [gRPC](https://grpc.io), a modern, high-performance remote procedure
protocol framework built on HTTP/2 for sending and receiving data securely and quickly. With gRPC, communication between
Palette's central management platform and your workload clusters remains efficient, secure, and reliable, even as your
environment scales.

## SaaS Network Communications and Ports

The following ports must be reachable from a network perspective for Palette SaaS to function correctly.

## Network Ports

The following ports must be reachable from a network perspective for Palette to operate properly.

### Management Platform

| Port            | Direction | Purpose                                                      |
| :-------------- | :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| HTTPS (tcp/443) | INBOUND   | Browser/API access to management platform .                  |
| HTTPS (tcp/443) | INBOUND   | gRPC communication between Palette and the workload cluster. |

### Workload Cluster

| Port            | Direction | Purpose                                                                    |
| :-------------- | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HTTPS (tcp/443) | OUTBOUND  | API access to management platform and gRPC                                 |
| HTTPS (tcp/443) | OUTBOUND  | gRPC, Registry (packs, integrations), Pack containers, Application Updates |

:::info

You can expose inbound port 22 for SSH if you would like to access your cluster nodes for troubleshooting remotely. This
is entirely optional and not required for Palette to operate appropriately.
