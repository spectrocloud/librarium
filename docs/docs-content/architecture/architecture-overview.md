Palette is available in three flexible deployment models:

- **Multi-tenant SaaS**: The management plane is hosted in AWS across three regions (us-east-1, us-west-1, us-west-2)
  and managed by Spectro Cloud. Each customer will occupy a tenant. The Spectro Cloud operation team controls when to
  upgrade the management plane.

- **Dedicated SaaS**: The management plane is hosted in a cloud/region specified by the customer in Spectro Cloud’s
  cloud account with a dedicated instance managed by Spectro Cloud. The customer can decide when to upgrade the
  management plane.

- **Self-hosted**: The management plane is hosted in the customer’s environment. It can be the customer’s on-prem VMware
  vSphere, OpenStack, bare metal, or in a public cloud using the customer’s cloud account.

## SaaS Architecture and Data Flow

The Palette SaaS platform can manage public clouds (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) and on-premises data center (VMware,
OpenStack, bare metal). The architecture and data flow slightly differ based on whether the target environment is a
public or an on-premises data center.

### SaaS to Public Clouds

The following diagram illustrates the data flow for the Palette SaaS platform to manage the EKS cluster using the user's
cloud account in AWS:

There are two main data flows represented in the provisioning flow (red) and monitoring flow (green).

- **Provisioning data flow**: A tenant user from the browser or API client (e.g., Terraform provider) to configure
  Cluster Profile, Cloud Configuration (e.g., which cloud account to use, cloud-specific placement settings like VPC,
  subnet), and cluster specifications (e.g., cluster size, node instance type, etc.). This information is sent to
  Palette. In turn, Palette will invoke the cloud API to talk to the cloud endpoint using the cloud credentials
  specified to provision the Kubernetes cluster. Once the cluster is provisioned, a Palette management agent will be
  pushed and installed in the cluster. This agent will receive the Cluster Profile and Cluster Specifications as the
  desired state from SaaS. The agent will further inspect the desired state and pull additional add-on integrations from
  Palette's public package registry, or optionally a private package registry hosted by the tenant user. Once all
  required add-on integrations are installed, the agent will send a message to SaaS to indicate the full-stack K8s
  provisioning is completed.

- **Monitoring data flow**: The agent will periodically report the cluster health status back to the Palette SaaS
  platform. The agent will also stay in the watch loop to check if the cluster's stat matches the declared desired
  state. If there is any deviation (e.g. a worker node is accidentally shut down by a user directly from the cloud
  console), the agent can either send an alert message or based on the policy, do auto reconciliation/self-healing to
  bring the cluster back to match with the desired state. If there is an updated Cluster Profile or Cluster Spec, the
  agent will receive the updated and desired state from SaaS. It will then enforce the desired state by making cluster
  configuration changes accordingly.

### SaaS to Private Clouds / Data Center / Bare Metal

For private clouds like VMware, since the Palette SaaS platform does not have direct access to the private cloud
endpoint (e.g., vCenter), there is one extra component, Palette Private Cloud Gateway, to be deployed in a private cloud
environment to act as the local orchestrator and the proxy between Palette’s SaaS platform and cloud endpoint. The
following diagram illustrates the data flow for the Palette SaaS platform to manage an on-prem VMware private data
center:

## Self-Hosted Architecture and Data Flow

Although the Palette SaaS platform fully supports both public clouds and data centers, some customers, especially with
regulated industry or air-gapped environments, may prefer to install Palette in their own environment behind the
firewall, so that they can control the platform upgrade cycles and ensure no sensitive data are exposed. For these use
cases, Palette supports a self-hosted on-premises installation. The platform updates and add-on integration contents can
be optionally downloaded from an on-prem private repository instead of pulling from Palette’s hosted public repository.
