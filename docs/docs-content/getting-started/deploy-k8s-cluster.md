This tutorial will teach you how to deploy a host cluster with Palette using Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure,
or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) cloud providers. You will learn about _Cluster Mode_ and _Cluster Profiles_ and how these
components enable you to deploy customized applications to Kubernetes with minimal effort.

As you navigate the tutorial, refer to this diagram to help you understand how Palette uses a cluster profile as a
blueprint for the host cluster you deploy. Palette clusters have the same node pools you may be familiar with: _control
plane nodes_ and _worker nodes_ where you will deploy applications. The result is a host cluster that Palette manages.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you will need the following.

- A public cloud account from one of these providers:

  - [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account)
  - [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-an-azure-account)
  - [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/docs/get-started)

- Register the cloud account in Palette. The following resources provide additional guidance.

  - [Register and Manage AWS Accounts](../clusters/public-cloud/aws/add-aws-accounts.md)
  - [Register and Manage Azure Cloud Accounts](../clusters/public-cloud/azure/azure-cloud.md)
  - [Register and Manage GCP Accounts](../clusters/public-cloud/gcp/add-gcp-accounts.md)

- An SSH Key Pair. Use the [Create and Upload an SSH Key](../clusters/cluster-management/ssh-keys.md) guide to learn how
  to create an SSH key and upload it to Palette.

  - AWS users must create an AWS Key pair before starting the tutorial. If you need additional guidance, check out the
    [Create EC2 SSH Key Pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ground-station/latest/ug/create-ec2-ssh-key-pair.html)
    tutorial.

- A Palette cluster profile. Follow the [Create a Cluster Profile](./create-cluster-profile.md) tutorial to create the
  required cluster profile for your chosen cloud provider.

application with no upstream dependencies.

## Cleanup

Use the following steps to remove all the resources you created for the tutorial.

To remove the cluster, navigate to the left **Main Menu** and click on **Clusters**. Select the cluster you want to
delete to access its details page.

Click on **Settings** to expand the menu, and select **Delete Cluster**.

![Delete cluster](/getting-started/getting-started_deploy-k8s-cluster_delete-cluster-button.webp)

You will be prompted to type in the cluster name to confirm the delete action. Type in the cluster name to proceed with
the delete step. The deletion process takes several minutes to complete.

<br />

:::info

If a cluster remains in the delete phase for over 15 minutes, it becomes eligible for a force delete. To trigger a force
delete, navigate to the cluster’s details page, click on **Settings**, then select **Force Delete Cluster**. Palette
automatically removes clusters stuck in the cluster deletion phase for over 24 hours.

:::

<br />

Once the cluster is deleted, navigate to the left **Main Menu** and click on **Profiles**. Find the cluster profile you
created and click on the **three-dot Menu** to display the **Delete** button. Select **Delete** and confirm the
selection to remove the cluster profile.

## Wrap-Up

In this tutorial, you used the cluster profile you created in the previous
[Create a Cluster Profile](./create-cluster-profile.md) tutorial to deploy a host cluster onto your preferred cloud
service provider. After the cluster deployed, you verified the Hello Universe application was successfully deployed.

We recommend that you continue to the
[Deploy Cluster Profile Updates](../tutorials/cluster-management/update-maintain/update-k8s-cluster.md) tutorial to
learn how to update your host cluster.
