Palette is a complete and integrated platform that enables organizations to effectively manage the entire lifecycle of
any combination of new or existing, simple or complex, small or large Kubernetes environments, whether in a data center
or the cloud.

With a unique approach to managing multiple clusters, Palette gives IT teams complete control, visibility, and
production-scale efficiencies to provide developers with highly curated Kubernetes stacks and tools based on their
specific needs, with granular governance and enterprise-grade security.

Palette VerteX edition is also available to meet the stringent requirements of regulated industries such as government
and public sector organizations. Palette VerteX integrates Spectro Cloudâ€™s Federal Information Processing Standards
(FIPS) 140-2 cryptographic modules. To learn more about FIPS-enabled Palette, check out

## What Makes Palette Different?

Palette provides benefits to developers and platform engineers who maintain Kubernetes environments.

### Full-Stack Management

Unlike rigid and prepackaged Kubernetes solutions, Palette allows users to construct flexible stacks from OS,
Kubernetes, container network interfaces (CNI), and container storage interfaces (CSI) to additional add-on application
services. As a result, the entire stack - not just the infrastructure - of Kubernetes is deployed, updated, and managed
as one unit, without split responsibility from virtual machines, base OS, Kubernetes infra, and add-ons.

### End-to-End Declarative Lifecycle Management

Palette offers the most comprehensive profile-based management for Kubernetes. It enables teams to drive consistency,
repeatability, and operational efficiency across multiple clusters in multiple environments with comprehensive day 0 -
day 2 management. Check out the [Cluster Profiles](./cluster-profiles.md) page to learn more about how cluster profiles
simplifies cluster deployment and maintenance.

### Any Environment

Palette has the richest coverage in supported environments that includes:

- Public Clouds: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and Tencent TKE. Palette supports both IaaS and managed Kubernetes services
  AWS EKS, Azure AKS and Google GKE.
- Data Centers: VMware, Nutanix, and OpenStack
- Bare Metal: Canonical MAAS
- Edge
