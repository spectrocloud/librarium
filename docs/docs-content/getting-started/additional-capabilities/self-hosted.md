## Self-Hosted Palette

By default, the Palette management plane is available as a multi-tenant SaaS deployment in a public cloud with multiple
availability zones. Should you need it, Palette is also offered as a dedicated SaaS instance, as well as a fully
self-hosted option that allows your teams to directly deploy and manage a private instance of the Palette management
plane in your data center or public cloud provider.

Self-hosted Palette puts you in full control of the management plane, including its configuration and the timing of
upgrades. A self-hosted instance may be necessary to meet compliance requirements or your organization's security
policies. You may also need to deploy an instance of Palette within an airgapped facility to manage clusters where
access to any outside service is not possible.

## Palette VerteX

Palette VerteX offers a simple, flexible, and secure way for government and regulated industries to deploy and manage
Kubernetes workloads containing sensitive and classified information. It is available as a self-hosted platform offering
that you can install in your data center or public cloud provider.

Palette VerteX is fully proven in operational environments as it has a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 9 designation,
making it suitable for use in high-security production environments up to Impact Levels (IL) 5, 6, and 6+. It enables
you to deploy and manage the life cycle of multiple Kubernetes clusters in various environments. These include
virtualized and bare metal data centers (such as [VMware vSphere](https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere.html) and
[Nutanix](https://www.nutanix.com/)), clouds (including [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/) and
[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/explore/global-infrastructure/government) government clouds), and edge
locations (including air-gapped setups), which makes VerteX also appropriate for addressing challenges like intermittent
connectivity or low bandwidth.

Additionally, VerteX incorporates validated Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 cryptographic modules
into its management plane and the Kubernetes clusters it deploys. It secures data in motion through encrypted Transport
Layer Security (TLS) communication channels, includes a suite of scanning tools, and offers CONUS support from a
dedicated public sector team. These capabilities ensure robust data protection for your organizationâ€™s infrastructure
and applications.
