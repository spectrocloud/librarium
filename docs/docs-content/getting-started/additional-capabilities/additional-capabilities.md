Palette offers a range of additional capabilities designed to enable its users to deploy, scale, and effectively manage
Kubernetes workloads across a wide variety of environments and deployment options.

This section introduces you to some of Palette's additional capabilities, which include:

- Managing thousands of clusters in remote locations with [Edge](./edge.md).
- Supporting high-security requirements with our FIPS-validated [VerteX](./self-hosted.md#palette-vertex) edition.
- Self-hosting the Palette management plane in your own environment with
  [Self-Hosted Palette](./self-hosted.md#self-hosted-palette).
- Integrating virtual machine workloads into Kubernetes environments with [Virtual Machine Orchestrator](./vmo.md).
