Palette supports integration with [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us). You can deploy and manage
[Host Clusters](../../glossary-all.md#host-cluster) in Azure or Azure Government. The concepts you learn about in the
Getting Started section are centered around a fictional case study company. This approach gives you a solution focused
approach, while introducing you with Palette workflows and capabilities.

## Get Started

In this section, you learn how to create a cluster profile. Then, you deploy a cluster to Azure by using Palette. Once
your cluster is deployed, you can update it using cluster profile updates.
