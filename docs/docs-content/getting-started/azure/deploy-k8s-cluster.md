This tutorial will teach you how to deploy a host cluster with Palette using Microsoft Azure. You will learn about
_Cluster Mode_ and _Cluster Profiles_ and how these components enable you to deploy customized applications to
Kubernetes with minimal effort.

As you navigate the tutorial, refer to this diagram to help you understand how Palette uses a cluster profile as a
blueprint for the host cluster you deploy. Palette clusters have the same node pools you may be familiar with: _control
plane nodes_ and _worker nodes_ where you will deploy applications. The result is a host cluster that Palette manages.
The concepts you learn about in the Getting Started section are centered around a fictional case study company,
Spacetastic Ltd.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you will need the following.

- Follow the steps described in the [Set up Palette with Azure](./setup.md) guide to authenticate Palette for use with
  your Azure cloud account.

- A Palette cluster profile. Follow the [Create a Cluster Profile](./create-cluster-profile.md) tutorial to create the
  required Azure cluster profile.

## Deploy a Cluster

The following steps will guide you through deploying the cluster infrastructure.

Navigate to the left **Main Menu** and select **Clusters**. Click on **Create Cluster**.

![Palette clusters overview page](/getting-started/getting-started_deploy-k8s-cluster_new_cluster.webp)

Palette will prompt you to select the type of cluster. Select **Azure IaaS** and click the **Start Azure IaaS
Configuration** button. Use the following steps to create a host cluster in Azure.

In the **Basic information** section, insert the general information about the cluster, such as the Cluster name,
Description, Tags, and Cloud account. Click on **Next**.

![Palette clusters basic information](/getting-started/azure/getting-started_deploy-k8s-cluster_clusters_basic_info.webp)

Click on **Add Cluster Profile**. A list is displayed of available profiles you can choose to deploy to Azure. Select
the cluster profile you created in the [Create a Cluster Profile](./create-cluster-profile.md) tutorial, named
**azure-profile**, and click on **Confirm**.

The **Cluster Profile** section displays all the layers in the cluster profile.

![palette clusters basic information](/getting-started/azure/getting-started_deploy-k8s-cluster_parameters.webp)

Each layer has a pack manifest file with the deploy configurations. The pack manifest file is in a YAML format. Each
pack contains a set of default values. You can change the manifest values if needed. Click on **Next** to proceed.

The **Cluster Config** section allows you to select the **Subscription**, **Region**, **Resource Group**, **Storage
account**, and **SSH Key** to apply to the host cluster. All clusters require you to assign an SSH key. Refer to the
[SSH Keys](../../clusters/cluster-management/ssh-keys.md) guide for information about uploading an SSH key.

When you are done selecting a **Subscription**, **Region**, **Resource Group**, **Storage account** and **SSH Key**,
click on **Next**.

The **Nodes Config** section allows you to configure the nodes that compose the control plane nodes and worker nodes of
the Kubernetes cluster.

Refer to the [Node Pool](../../clusters/cluster-management/node-pool.md) guide for a list and description of parameters.

Before you proceed to next section, review the following parameters.

- **Number of nodes in the pool** - This option sets the number of control plane or worker nodes in the control plane or
  worker pool. For this tutorial, set the count to one for both the control plane and worker pools.

- **Allow worker capability** - This option allows the control plane node to also accept workloads. This is useful when
  spot instances are used as worker nodes. You can check this box if you want to.

- **Instance Type** - Select the compute type for the node pool. Each instance type displays the amount of CPU, RAM, and
  hourly cost of the instance. Select **Standard_A8_v2**.

- **Managed disk** - Used to select the storage class. Select **Standard LRS** and set the disk size to **60**.

- **Availability zones** - Used to specify the availability zones in which the node pool can place nodes. Select an
  availability zone.

![Palette clusters nodes configuration](/getting-started/azure/getting-started_deploy-k8s-cluster_cluster_nodes_config.webp)

In the **Cluster Settings** section, you can configure advanced options such as when to patch the OS, enable security
scans, manage backups, add Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) bindings, and more.

For this tutorial, you can use the default settings. Click on **Validate** to continue.

The Review section allows you to review the cluster configuration before deploying the cluster. Review all the settings
and click on **Finish Configuration** to deploy the cluster.

![Configuration overview of newly created Azure cluster](/getting-started/azure/getting-started_deploy-k8s-cluster_profile_review.webp)

Navigate to the left **Main Menu** and select **Clusters**.

![Update the cluster](/getting-started/azure/getting-started_deploy-k8s-cluster_create_cluster.webp)

The cluster deployment process can take 15 to 30 min. The deployment time varies depending on the cloud provider,
cluster profile, cluster size, and the node pool configurations provided. You can learn more about the deployment
progress by reviewing the event log. Click on the **Events** tab to view the log.

![Update the cluster](/getting-started/azure/getting-started_deploy-k8s-cluster_event_log.webp)

## Verify the Application

Navigate to the left **Main Menu** and select **Clusters**.

Select your cluster to view its **Overview** tab. When the application is deployed and ready for network traffic,
indicated in the **Services** field, Palette exposes the service URL. Click on the URL for port **:8080** to access the
Hello Universe application.

![Cluster details page with service URL highlighted](/getting-started/azure/getting-started_deploy-k8s-cluster_service_url.webp)

<br />

:::warning

It can take up to three minutes for DNS to properly resolve the public load balancer URL. We recommend waiting a few
moments before clicking on the service URL to prevent the browser from caching an unresolved DNS request.

Welcome to Spacetastic's astronomy education platform. Feel free to explore the pages and learn more about space. The
statistics page offers information on visitor counts on your deployed service.

You have deployed your first application to a cluster managed by Palette. Your first application is a three-tier
application with a frontend, API server, and Postgres database.

## Cleanup

Use the following steps to remove all the resources you created for the tutorial.

To remove the cluster, navigate to the left **Main Menu** and click on **Clusters**. Select the cluster you want to
delete to access its details page.

Click on **Settings** to expand the menu, and select **Delete Cluster**.

![Delete cluster](/getting-started/azure/getting-started_deploy-k8s-cluster_delete-cluster-button.webp)

You will be prompted to type in the cluster name to confirm the delete action. Type in the cluster name to proceed with
the delete step. The deletion process takes several minutes to complete.

<br />

:::info

If a cluster remains in the delete phase for over 15 minutes, it becomes eligible for a force delete. To trigger a force
delete, navigate to the cluster‚Äôs details page, click on **Settings**, then select **Force Delete Cluster**. Palette
automatically removes clusters stuck in the cluster deletion phase for over 24 hours.

:::

<br />

Once the cluster is deleted, navigate to the left **Main Menu** and click on **Profiles**. Find the cluster profile you
created and click on the **three-dot Menu** to display the **Delete** button. Select **Delete** and confirm the
selection to remove the cluster profile.

## Wrap-Up

In this tutorial, you used the cluster profile you created in the previous
[Create a Cluster Profile](./create-cluster-profile.md) tutorial to deploy a host cluster onto your preferred cloud
service provider. After the cluster deployed, you verified the Hello Universe application was successfully deployed.

We recommend that you continue to the [Deploy Cluster Profile Updates](./update-k8s-cluster.md) tutorial to learn how to
update your host cluster.
