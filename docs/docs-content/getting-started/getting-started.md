This page gives an overview of getting started with Spectro Cloud Palette quickly. We introduce Palette's complimentary
subscription plans, features, workflow, and user experience session to our users.

The first step towards adopting Palette to your organization is to
[create a login](https://www.spectrocloud.com/get-started). The
[Palette Free Tier](https://www.spectrocloud.com/free-tier) gives our users the opportunity to get a first impression of
our product before making a purchase decision.

After successful account creation, Palette presents a well-organized Product Onboarding Workflow to streamline the user
product adoption. The onboarding process consists of explaining our product features, followed by a Palette experience
session. Here we furnish an easy-to-follow deployment pipeline for our users to launch their first cluster successfully.
