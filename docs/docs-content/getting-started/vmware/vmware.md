Palette supports integration with [VMware](https://www.vmware.com). You can deploy and manage
[Host Clusters](../../glossary-all.md#host-cluster) on VMware. The concepts you learn about in the Getting Started
section are centered around a fictional case study company. This approach gives you a solution focused approach, while
introducing you with Palette workflows and capabilities.

## Get Started

In this section, you learn how to create a cluster profile. Then, you deploy a cluster to VMware vSphere using Palette.
Once your cluster is deployed, you can update it using cluster profile updates.
