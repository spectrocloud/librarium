Palette supports using [VMware](https://www.vmware.com) as a data center provider. You can deploy and manage
[Host Clusters](../../glossary-all.md#host-cluster) on VMware virtual machines.

## Get Started

In this section, you learn how to create a cluster profile. Then, you deploy a cluster to VMware vSphere using Palette.
Once your cluster is deployed, you can update it using cluster profile updates.
