With Palette, you can bring your own operating system and use it with your Kubernetes clusters using the [Bring Your Own Operating System (BYOOS)](../../glossary-all.md#bringyourownoperatingsystem(byoos)) feature. The BYOOS pack allows you to upload your own OS images, configure the necessary drivers, and customize the OS to meet your specific requirements.



Bringing your own operating system provides several benefits, including the ability to control your own dependencies, improve performance, and ensure compatibility with your existing applications. With BYOOS, you can choose the OS that best fits your needs, whether it's a commercial or open-source distribution, and integrate it with your Kubernetes clusters.



The BYOOS feature is especially useful for enterprises and organizations that have strict requirements around security, compliance, or specific hardware configurations. With the ability to bring your own OS, you can ensure that your Kubernetes clusters meet these requirements, without compromising on performance or functionality.



BYOOS in Palette gives you greater flexibility, control, and customization options when managing your Kubernetes clusters. You can tailor your OS to your specific needs, ensuring your clusters perform optimally and meet your organization's unique requirements.
