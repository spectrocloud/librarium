# Cluster Deployment Errors Scenarios

The following steps will help you troubleshoot errors in the event issues arise while deploying a cluster.

## Instances Continuously Delete Every 30 Minutes

An instance is launched and terminated every 30 minutes prior to completion of its deployment, and the **Events Tab**
lists errors with the following message:

<br />

```hideClipboard bash
Failed to update kubeadmControlPlane Connection timeout connecting to Kubernetes Endpoint
```

This behavior can occur when Kubernetes services for the launched instance fail to start properly. Common reasons for
why a service may fail are:

- The specified image could not be pulled from the image repository.
- The cloud init process failed.

### Debug Steps

1. Initiate an SSH session with the Kubernetes instance using the SSH key provided during provisioning, and log in as
   user `spectro`. If you are initiating an SSH session into an installer instance, log in as user `ubuntu`.

   ```shell
       ssh --identity_file <_pathToYourSSHkey_> spectro@X.X.X.X
   ```

2. Elevate the user access.

   ```shell
       sudo -i
   ```

3. Verify the Kubelet service is operational.

   ```shell
       systemctl status kubelet.service
   ```

4. If the Kubelet service does not work as expected, do the following. If the service operates correctly, you can skip
   this step.

   1. Navigate to the **/var/log/** folder.
      ```shell
      cd /var/log/
      ```
   2. Scan the **cloud-init-output** file for any errors. Take note of any errors and address them.
      ```
      cat cloud-init-output.log
      ```

5. If the kubelet service works as expected, do the following.

   - Export the kubeconfig file.

   ```shell
       export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
   ```

   - Connect with the cluster's Kubernetes API.

   ```shell
       kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
   ```

   - When the connection is established, verify the pods are in a _Running_ state. Take note of any pods that are not in
     _Running_ state.

   ```shell
       kubectl get pods -o wide
   ```

   - If all the pods are operating correctly, verify their connection with the Palette API.

     - For clusters using Gateway, verify the connection between the Installer and Gateway instance:
       ```shell
          curl -k https://<KUBE_API_SERVER_IP>:6443
       ```
     - For Public Clouds that do not use Gateway, verify the connection between the public Internet and the Kube
       endpoint:

       ```shell
           curl -k https://<KUBE_API_SERVER_IP>:6443
       ```

       :::info

       You can obtain the URL for the Kubernetes API using this command: `kubectl cluster-info`.

       :::

6. Check stdout for errors. You can also open a support ticket. Visit our
   [support page](http://support.spectrocloud.io/).

## Deployment Violates Pod Security

Cluster deployment fails with the following message.

```
Error creating: pods <name of pod> is forbidden: violates PodSecurity "baseline:v<k8s version>": non-default capabilities â€¦
```

This can happen when the cluster profile uses Kubernetes 1.25 or later and also includes packs that create pods that
require elevated privileges.

### Debug Steps

To address this issue, you can change the Pod Security Standards of the namespace where the pod is being created.

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com).

2. Navigate to the left **Main Menu** and click on **Profiles**.

3. Select the profile you are using to deploy the cluster. Palette displays the profile stack and details.
4. Click on the pack layer in the profile stack that contains the pack configuration.

5. In the pack's YAML file, add a subfield in the `pack` section called `namespaceLabels` if it does not already exist.

6. In the `namespaceLabels` section, add a line with the name of your namespace as the key and add
   `pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=privileged,pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version=v<k8s_version>` as its
   value. Replace `<k8s_version>` with the version of Kubernetes on your cluster and only include the major and minor
   version following the lowercase letter `v`. For example, `v1.25` and `v1.28`.
7. If a key matching your namespace already exists, add the labels to the value corresponding to that key.

:::warning

We recommend only applying the labels to namespaces where pods fail to be created. If your pack creates multiple
namespaces, and you are unsure which ones contain pods that need the elevated privileges, you can access the cluster
with the kubectl CLI and use the `kubectl get pods` command. This command lists pods and their namespaces so you can
identify the pods that are failing at creation.

For guidance in using the CLI, review
[Access Cluster with CLI](../clusters/cluster-management/palette-webctl.md#access-cluster-with-cli). To learn more about
kubectl pod commands, refer to the
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#get) documentation.

### Examples

The following example shows a pack that creates a namespace called `"monitoring"`. In this example, the `monitoring`
namespace does not have any pre-existing labels. You need to add the `namespaceLabels` line as well as the corresponding
key-value pair under it to apply the labels to the `monitoring` namespace.

```yaml
pack:
  namespace: "monitoring"

  namespaceLabels:
    "monitoring": "pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=privileged,pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version=v1.28"
```

This second example is similar to the first one. However, in this example, the `monitoring` key already exists under
`namespaceLabels`, with its original value being `"org=spectro,team=dev"`. Therefore, you add the labels to the existing
value:

```yaml
pack:
  namespace: "monitoring"

  namespaceLabels:
    "monitoring": "org=spectro,team=dev,pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=privileged,pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version=v1.28"
```

## Gateway Installer Registration Failures

There are a couple reasons the Gateway Installer might fail:

- A bootstrap error might have occurred. When the Gateway Installer VM is powered on, it initiates a bootstrap process
  and registers itself with the tenant portal. This process typically takes 5 to 10 minutes. If the installer fails to
  register with the tenant portal during this time, it indicates a bootstrapping error.

  To address the issue, SSH into the Installer virtual machine using the key provided during OVA import and inspect the
  log file located at _'/var/log/cloud-init-output.log'_.

  The log file contains error messages about any failures that occur while connecting to the Spectro Cloud management
  platform portal, authenticating, or downloading installation artifacts.

  A common cause for these errors is that the Spectro Cloud management platform console endpoint or the pairing code is
  typed incorrectly. Ensure that the tenant portal console endpoint does not have a trailing slash. If these properties
  were incorrectly specified, power down and delete the installer VM and re-launch with the correct values.

- The VM may not have an outbound connection. The Gateway Installer VM requires outbound connectivity directly or using
  a proxy. Adjust proxy settings, if applicable, to fix the connectivity or power down and delete the Installer VM, then
  relaunch it in a network that enables outbound connections.

If these steps do not resolve the Gateway Installer issues, copy the following script to the Installer VM to generate a
logs archive. Open a support ticket by visiting our [support page](http://support.spectrocloud.io/). Attach the logs
archive so the Spectro Cloud Support team can troubleshoot the issue and provide further guidance:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

DESTDIR="/tmp/"

CONTAINER_LOGS_DIR="/var/log/containers/"
CLOUD_INIT_OUTPUT_LOG="/var/log/cloud-init-output.log"
CLOUD_INIT_LOG="/var/log/cloud-init.log"
KERN_LOG="/var/log/kern.log"
KUBELET_LOG="/tmp/kubelet.log"
SYSLOGS="/var/log/syslog*"

FILENAME=spectro-logs-$(date +%-Y%-m%-d)-$(date +%-HH%-MM%-SS).tgz


journalctl -u kubelet > $KUBELET_LOG

tar --create --gzip -h --file=$DESTDIR$FILENAME $CONTAINER_LOGS_DIR $CLOUD_INIT_LOG $CLOUD_INIT_OUTPUT_LOG $KERN_LOG $KUBELET_LOG $SYSLOGS

retVal=$?
if [ $retVal -eq 1 ]; then
    echo "Error creating spectro logs package"
else
	echo "Successfully extracted spectro cloud logs: $DESTDIR$FILENAME"
fi
```

## Gateway Cluster Provisioning Failures

Installation of the Gateway cluster may run into errors or get stuck in the provisioning state for various reasons like
lack of infrastructure resources, lack of availability of IP addresses, inability to perform NTP sync, etc.

While these are the most common failures, some other issues might be related to the underlying VMware environment. The
**Cluster Details** page, which you can access by clicking anywhere on the Gateway widget, contains details of every
orchestration step, including an indication of the current task.

Intermittent errors are displayed on the **Cluster Details** page next to the relevant orchestration task. The
**Events** tab on this page also provides helpful insights into lower-level operations currently being performed.
Suppose you believe the orchestration is stuck or failed due to an invalid selection of infrastructure resources or an
intermittent problem with the infrastructure. You may reset the Gateway by clicking on the **Reset** button on the
Gateway widget. The Gateway state will transition to Pending. A Gateway in the Pending state allows you to reconfigure
the Gateway and start provisioning a new Gateway cluster. If the problem persists, don't hesitate to contact Spectro
support via the Service Desk or our [support page](http://support.spectrocloud.io/).
