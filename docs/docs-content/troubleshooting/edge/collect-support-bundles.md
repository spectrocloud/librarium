When deploying or operating edge clusters, you may encounter issues that require assistance from the SpectroCloud support team, such as edge hosts failing to register, pod failures, or provisioning errors. To help our team troubleshoot these issues more effectively, follow this guide to collect support bundles and attach them to your support ticket.
## Limitations
- This guide applies only to connected installation mode, not airgap environments, since it requires internet access to run the troubleshooting script.
## Prerequisites
- You have connected to the host you need to troubleshoot, using SSH, direct terminal access, or another connection method.
- The following tools are available on the host:
    - `journalctl`
    - `systemctl`
    - `kubectl` (optional)
