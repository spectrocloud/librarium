The following are common scenarios that you may encounter when using Virtual Machine Orchestrator (VMO).

## Scenario - Virtual Machines (VM) Stuck in a Migration Loop

Clusters with the VMO pack may experience VMs getting stuck in a continuous migration loop, as indicated by a
`Migrating` or `Migration` VM status. Use the following steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue.

### Debug Steps

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com) and click **Clusters** from the left **Main Menu**.

2. Select your cluster and click on the **Profile** tab.

3. Select the VMO pack layer and click **Values** under the **Pack Details** section.

4. Comment out the following lines under the `kubevirtResource` section and click **Save**.

   ```yaml
   workloads: {}
   # workloadsUpdateStrategy:
   #     workloadUpdateMethods:
   #     - LiveMigrate
   ```

5. The KubeVirt custom resource may fail to update after changing the VMO pack values in the Palette UI. To ensure the
   changes take effect, follow the [Access Cluster with CLI](../clusters/cluster-management/palette-webctl.md) guide to
   connect to your host cluster using the [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) CLI.

6. In your terminal, issue the following command to edit the KubeVirt custom resource.

   ```bash
   kubectl edit kubevirt --namespace kubevirt
   ```

7. Comment out the following lines under the `spec` block and save the file.

   ```yaml
   # workloadUpdateStrategy:
   #   workloadUpdateMethods:
   #   - LiveMigrate
   ```

8. Within a few minutes, the VMs will stop being stuck in the continuous migration loop.

   :::warning

   Step **4** affects the [CPU Hotplug](../vm-management/create-manage-vm/enable-cpu-hotplug.md) functionality. If your
   cluster has CPU Hotplug enabled, you will need to manually restart your VM each time you add a virtual CPU for the
   changes to take effect.

## Scenario - OVA Imports Fail Due To Storage Class Attribute

If you are importing an OVA file through the Palette CLI
[VMO command](../automation/palette-cli/commands/vmo.md#import-ova), `import-ova`, and the import fails. It may be due
to the VMO cluster using a `storageClass` with an unsupported volume bind mode, such as
`volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer`. To address this issue, use the following steps to update the `storageClass`
attribute for the VMO cluster.

### Debug Steps

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com)

2. Navigate to the **left Main Menu** and select **Clusters**.

3. Select your VMO cluster to access the cluster details page.

4. Download the cluster's kubeconfig file by clicking the URL for the **Kubeconfig File**. For additional guidance,
   check out the [Kubeconfig](../clusters/cluster-management/kubeconfig.md) guide.

5. Open a terminal session and export the kubeconfig file to your terminal session.

   ```bash
   export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/your/kubeconfig
   ```

6. Use [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) to create a new _StorageClass_ with
   `volumeBindingMode: Immediate`. Use the following command to create the new _StorageClass_.

   ```bash
    cat <<EOF | kubectl apply --filename -
    apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
    kind: StorageClass
    metadata:
      name: immediate
    provisioner: csi.vsphere.vmware.com
    parameters:
      fstype: ext4
    reclaimPolicy: Delete
    volumeBindingMode: Immediate
    EOF
   ```

7. Select the new _StorageClass_ when prompted during the Palette CLI's OVA import process. You can learn more about the
   OVA import process in the [VMO command](../automation/palette-cli/commands/vmo.md#import-ova) page.
