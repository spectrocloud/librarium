# Palette Upgrades

We recommend you review the [Release Notes](../release-notes.md) and the [Upgrade Notes](../enterprise-version/upgrade.md) before attempting to upgrade Palette. Use this information to address common issues that may occur during an upgrade.



## Ingress Errors

If you receive the following error message when attempting to upgrade to Palette versions greater than Palette 3.4.X in a Kubernetes environment, use the debugging steps to address the issue.

<br />

```hideClipboard text
Error: UPGRADE FAILED: failed to create resource: admission webhook "validate.nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io" denied the request: host "_" and path "/v1/oidc" is already defined in ingress default/hubble-auth-oidc-ingress-resource
```


## Debug Steps

1. Connect to the cluster using the cluster's kubeconfig file. Refer to the [Access Cluster with CLI](../clusters/cluster-management/palette-webctl.md) for additional guidance.



2. Identify all Ingress resources that belong to *Hubble* - an internal Palette component.

  <br />

 	```shell
  kubectl get ingress --namespace default
  ```

3. Remove each Ingress resource listed in the output that starts with the name Hubble. Use the following command to delete an Ingress resource. Replace `REPLACE_ME` with the name of the Ingress resource you are removing.

  <br />

  ```shell
  kubectl delete ingress --namespace default <REPLACE_ME>
  ```


4. Restart the upgrade process.
