## Usage

To use the Virtual Machine Orchestrator pack, create either a full Palette cluster profile or an add-on Palette cluster
profile and add this pack to your profile. Refer to the [Create a VMO Profile](../vm-management/create-vmo-profile.md)
guide for further details.

After defining the cluster profile, use it to deploy a new cluster or attach it as an add-on profile to an existing
cluster. For more information, refer to the [Getting Started](/getting-started/) tutorials.

Once the Virtual Machine Orchestrator pack is installed, you can deploy and manage VMs on the cluster. Refer to the
[Create and Manage VMs](../vm-management/create-manage-vm/create-manage-vm.md) section for more information.

:::warning

Ensure that you delete all virtual machines before removing the Virtual Machine Orchestrator pack from your cluster.
