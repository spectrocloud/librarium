## Disable UDP Segmentation on VMXNET3 Edge Hosts for Clusters with Overlay Networks

Due to a [known issue with VMware's VMXNET3 adapter](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/13096#issuecomment-723901955),
which is widely used in different virtual machine management services, including VMware vSphere and Hyper-V, Cilium Pods may face network connectivity issues.

If deploying an Edge host in a virtual machine environment using an VMXNET3 adapter and enabling an <VersionedLink text="overlay network" url="/clusters/edge/networking/vxlan-overlay /> for your cluster, add the following commands in the `user-data` file at the boot stage. Replace `<interface-name>` with the name of the network interface on your Edge host.

  ```yaml {2-6}
  stages:
    initramfs:
      - name: "Disable UDP segmentation"
        commands:
          - ethtool --offload <interface-name> tx-udp_tnl-segmentation off
          - ethtool --offload <interface-name> tx-udp_tnl-csum-segmentation off

  ```

## Troubleshooting

### Scenario - I/O Timeout Error on VMware

If you are deploying a cluster to a VMware environment using the VXLAN tunnel protocol, you may encounter I/O timeout
errors. This is due to a known bug in the VXMNET3 adapter that results in VXLAN traffic being dropped. You can learn
more about this issue in Cilium's [GitHub issue #21801](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/21801).

You can work around the issue by using one of the two following methods:

- Option 1: Set a different tunnel protocol in the Cilium configuration. You can set the tunnel protocol to `geneve`.

  ```yaml
  charts:
    cilium:
      tunnelProtocol: "geneve"
  ```

- Option 2: Modify the Operating System (OS) layer of your cluster profile to automatically disable UDP Segmentation
  Offloading (USO).

  ```yaml
  kubeadmconfig:
    preKubeadmCommands:
      # Disable hardware segmentation offloading due to VMXNET3 issue
      - |
        install -m 0755 /dev/null /usr/lib/networkd-dispatcher/routable.d/10-disable-offloading
        cat <<EOF > /usr/lib/networkd-dispatcher/routable.d/10-disable-offloading
        #!/bin/sh
        ethtool -K eth0 tx-udp_tnl-segmentation off
        ethtool -K eth0 tx-udp_tnl-csum-segmentation off
        ethtool --offload eth0 rx off tx off
        EOF
        systemctl restart systemd-networkd
  ```

## Terraform

You can reference the Cilium pack in Terraform with the following data resource.

```hcl
data "spectrocloud_registry" "public_registry" {
  name = "Public Repo"
}

data "spectrocloud_pack" "cilium" {
  name    = "cni-cilium-oss"
  version = "1.15.3"
  registry_uid = data.spectrocloud_registry.public_registry.id
}
```
