Flannel is a network layer three fabric for Kubernetes. It's designed to work with Linux routing infrastructure and creates a virtual network that gives each computing host a subnet. Flannel uses either the Kubernetes API or etcd directly to store the network configuration, the allocated subnets, and any auxiliary data such as the hostâ€™s public IP address. To learn more about Flannel, refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#how-it-works).
