Palette supports two pack categories: *Core* and *Add-on*. Core packs, which we often source from third parties, are infrastructure related or have prominence in container-based environments. They create the layers in Palette profiles. Core packs are grouped as follows:

- Kubernetes

- Operating System (OS)

- Container Network Interface (CNI)

- Container Storage Interface (CSI)


Add-on packs provide additional functionality that you can add to your cluster profile and are grouped as follows:

- Load Balancer

- Ingress

- Logging

- Monitoring

- Security

- Authenticaiton

- System Apps


Check out the [Packs List](integrations.mdx) document, where you can use the filter buttons to display a list of Palette packs in each category and learn about the individual packs.

## Pack Updates

Packs undergo rigorous vulnerability scans and penetration testing before they become available in Palette. The following sections describe our update schedule for each core pack category. 

<br />

### Kubernetes Packs

We provide Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Kubernetes updates as follows:

<br />

- **Major versions**: Assessed based on the extent of changes.


- **Minor versions**: Provided within eight weeks of a new Kubernetes release.


- **Patch versions**: Provided within four weeks of a new Kubernetes release.



### OS Packs

We provide Ubuntu LTS and CentOS updates for IaaS clusters as follows:

<br />

- **Major versions** - Added within 8 weeks of release.


- **Patch and Minor versions**:  Updated at runtime using Paletteâ€™s on-demand or scheduled OS upgrades and patch-on-boot capabilities.


### CNI Packs

We provide CNI pack updates as follows:

<br />

- **Major versions**: Assessed based on the extent of changes.


- **Minor version**: Added within 6 weeks of release.


- **Patch versions**: Added within 4 weeks of release.


### CSI Packs

We provide CSI pack updates as follows:

<br />

- **Major versions**: Assessed based on the extent of changes.


- **Minor version**: Added within 6 weeks of release.


- **Patch versions**: Added within 4 weeks of release.


### Add-on Packs

We provide add-on pack updates as follows:

<br />

- **Major versions**: Assessed based on the extent of changes.


- **Minor version**: Added within 6 weeks of release.


- **Patch versions**: Added within 4 weeks of release.


## Packs Deprecation


We deprecate and remove packs when a more stable version of the pack is available or when the underlying technology becomes obsolete. When a pack is deprecated, you will still be able to create new cluster profiles using the pack and deploy clusters that use profiles containing the pack.

Palette displays the deprecation stage when you click the information icon next to the pack name during profile creation.

An information icon in the profile stack also displays a message that instructs about required pack versions.

We adhere to the following stages of deprecation: 

<br />

- **Deprecated**: When a pack or a pack version is deprecated, this indicates it will be removed in the future. You will still be able to create new cluster profiles using the pack and launch clusters using existing profiles that contain the pack.

   The pack remains in *Deprecated* state for three months before it moves to *Disabled* state.

   <br />

- **Disabled**: When a pack is disabled, it is no longer available for selection in Palette. When creating new profiles, you must use a newer version of the pack. You can still launch clusters using existing profiles that contain the disabled pack.

  The pack remains in *Disabled* state for three months before it is deleted.

  <br />

- **Deleted**: When a pack is deleted, it is removed from Palette. An active cluster that contains the deleted pack will continue to operate. However, you will not be able to deploy a new cluster profile that contains the deleted pack.

### Kubernetes Packs

A minor Kubernetes version is deprecated in Palette when the Kubernetes community announces the version is entering End of Life (EOL). 

<br />

### CNI / CSI / Add-on Packs

Palette supports a minor version of CNI, CSI, and add-on packs until two newer versions are available. At that time, packs in these categories are deprecated.
