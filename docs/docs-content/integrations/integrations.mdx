Palette provides packs that are tailored for specific uses to support the core infrastructure a cluster needs and add-on
packs to extend Kubernetes functionality. Each pack you add to a cluster profile is considered a layer in the profile.

When you create a cluster profile, you choose the type of pack you want to add: **Full**, **Infrastructure**, or
**Add-on**. **Full** refers to the combination of **Infrastructure** and **Add-on** packs.

When you choose **Infrastructure** or **Add-on**, Palette presents only packs that provide functionality for the
selected pack type. When you choose **Full**, Palette presents all the packs so you can build your cluster profile from
the base layer up. To learn more about cluster profiles, check out the
[Cluster Profiles](profiles/cluster-profiles/cluster-profiles.md) reference.

To learn more about individual packs, use the search bar below to find a specific option. Alternatively, you can use the
filter buttons to display available options. To learn about pack update and deprecation schedules, review
[Maintenance Policy](/integrations/maintenance-policy).
