Palette Community Packs are packs that are created and maintained by the Spectro Cloud community. They provide important
integrations with Spectro Cloud Palette.

We welcome all contributions to the Spectro Cloud community packs, either by adding new packs or updating existing
packs. You can read our
[Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/spectrocloud/pack-central?tab=readme-ov-file#contributing) in the community
packs repository. Check out the [Deploy a Custom Pack](../registries-and-packs/deploy-pack.md) tutorial to learn more
about how to build and deploy your own custom pack.

:::warning

All community packs are reviewed, and if they have followed the
[Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/spectrocloud/pack-central?tab=readme-ov-file#contributing), they are
accepted by Spectro Cloud. However, unlike [Verified Packs](./verified_packs.md), Spectro Cloud does not actively
maintain and update community packs. Therefore, updates to these packs depend on community contributors.

### Supported Environments

Palette comes with a default community pack registry hosted by Spectro Cloud that is available to all tenants in the
[Multi-tenant SaaS](../architecture/architecture-overview.md) architecture. For different deployment models, the
registry must be added manually. Refer to the table below to check if your environment includes the Palette Community
Registry. If your environment does not include the registry, contact our
[support team](https://www.spectrocloud.com/contact) for assistance.

## Prerequisites

- Your Palette account role must have the `clusterProfile.create` permission to create a profile. Refer to the
  [Roles and Permissions](../user-management/palette-rbac/project-scope-roles-permissions.md#cluster-profile-admin)
  documentation for more information.
- Ensure that the community registry is available in your Palette [environment](#supported-environments).

## Use Community Packs

Use the following steps to create a cluster profile by adding one or more layers using community packs.

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com/).

2. From the left **Main Menu** click **Profiles**.

3. Click on the **Add Cluster Profile** button.

4. Fill out the cluster profile name and description.

5. Select **Add-on** for the cluster profile type. Click on **Next** to continue.
