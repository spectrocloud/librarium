Palette supports Antrea controller network interface (CNI) for VMware Kubernetes clusters. Antrea CNI enables each pod
to have exclusive IP addresses from the subnet with direct accessibility.

Antrea leverages [Open vSwitch](https://www.openvswitch.org/) to implement pod networking and security features. Open
vSwitch enables Antrea to implement Kubernetes network policies efficiently.

## Troubleshooting

If routing problems occur or some hosts cannot communicate outside their subnet, this indicates overlapping IP addresses
or conflicting CIDR IPs.

Ensure you have provided a non-overlapping IP address for your pod network in Palette's Kubernetes manifest using the
`podCIDR` parameter. The CIDR IP specified with the `podCIDR` parameter in the Kubernetes manifest always takes
precedence.

If you wish to use Antrea CIDRs and have deployed a cluster using Palette, ensure that you have done the following:

- Removed any value for `podCIDR` and `serviceCIDR` in the Kubernetes manifest.
- Provided a non-overlapping IP address for your pod network.

## Terraform

You can reference the Antrea CNI pack in Terraform with a data resource.

```hcl
data "spectrocloud_registry" "public_registry" {
 name = "Public Repo"
}

data "spectrocloud_pack_simple" "antrea" {
 name    = "antrea"
 version = "1.9.0"
 type = "helm"
 registry_uid = data.spectrocloud_registry.public_registry.id
}
```
