Palette Verified Packs are packs that we build and actively maintain. We configure verified packs according to best practices, continuously update them, and monitor them for security vulnerabilities. Verified packs are easily recognized by the green shield icon that distinguishes them from other packs.

<!-- Verified Packs display in Palette with a green shield icon to distinguish them from other packs. -->

We offer verified packs for all layers in the cluster profile stack - from infrastructure layers to application layers. Our OS and Kubernetes packs are hardened using Center for Internet Security (CIS) standards. 

## Verified Pack Updates

Verified packs are updated every six to eight weeks with any needed configuration adjustments. To learn about our general pack maintenance policy, review the [Maintenancy Policy](maintenance-policy.md) reference.
 
### Hotfix Release Schedule

We have a weekly hotfix release schedule in place to roll out urgent fixes. If any pack is found to have a security issue, we quickly address the issue and release it as a hotfix.  

### Minor Releases

Any critical, high, or medium concerns are addressed in an upcoming minor release and occur independent of Palette release timelines.
