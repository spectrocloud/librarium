Palette Verified Packs are packs that we at Spectro Cloud build and actively maintain. We configure verified packs according to best practices, continuously update them, and monitor verified packs for security vulnerabilities. Verified packs display in Palette with a green shield icon.

We offer verified packs for all layers in the profile stack - from infrastructure layers to application layers. Our OS and Kubernetes packs are hardened using Center for Internet Security (CIS) standards.

## Verified Pack Updates

Verified packs are updated every six to eight weeks with any needed configuration adjustments. 

 
  
 
### Hotfix Release Schedule

We have a weekly hotfix release schedule in place to roll out urgent fixes. If any pack is found to have a security issue, we quickly address the issue and release it as a hotfix.  

### Minor Releases

Any critical, high, or medium concerns are addressed in an upcoming minor release. Take note that regular pack updates to address issues occur independent of Palette release timelines. Your Spectro Cloud Palette subscription covers access to our Support team and product updates.
