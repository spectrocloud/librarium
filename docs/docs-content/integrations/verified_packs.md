Palette Verified Packs are packs that we at Spectro Cloud build and actively maintain with continuous updates and monitoring for security vulnerabilities. We use our extensive knowledge to ensure verified packs are configured according to best practices. We offer verified packs across the spectrum of a typical cluster profile stack - from the Operating System (OS) layer up to application layers. Verified packs are easily recognized in Palette by the green shield icon that distinguishes them from other packs.

### Verified Pack Updates

Verified packs are updated every six to eight weeks to ensure they are always current. These updates include any necessary configuration adjustments. Additionally, our OS and Kubernetes packs are hardened using Center for Internet Security (CIS) standards, and we update them periodically to align with best practices. If any pack is found to have a security issue, we quickly address it and, depending on the severity of the issue, we may release a patch fix. To address patch fixes, we have established a weekly hotfix release schedule to flexibly roll out urgent fixes as needed.

Where relevant, any recently identified critical, high, or medium concerns will be addressed in an upcoming minor release, which occurs independent of Palette release timelines.
