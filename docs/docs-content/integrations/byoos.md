# Bring Your Own Operating System (BYOOS)

The [Bring Your Own Operating System (BYOOS)](../byoos/byoos.md) enables you to use a custom Operating System (OS) with
Palette. Palette comes with several operating systems out-of-the-box, but the existing OS list may not meet all users'
needs.

Using your custom OS provides several benefits, including the ability to control your own dependencies, improve
performance, and ensure compatibility with your existing applications. With BYOOS, you can choose the OS that best fits
your needs, whether it's a commercial or open-source distribution, and integrate it with your Kubernetes clusters. The
BYOOS pack can be used with both Edge and non-Edge environments.

## Versions Supported

**1.0.x**

<br />

<Tabs queryString="versions">

<TabItem label="Edge" value="edge">

## Prerequisites

<br />

- The Edge Provider images you have created and uploaded to a container registry. Refer to the
  [Build Edge Artifacts](../clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/palette-canvos.md) guide for steps on how to create the
  Edge artifacts and how to upload your custom OS to a registry.

- Palette 3.3.0 or greater.

## Parameters

The BYOS Edge OS pack supports the following parameters.

### Parameters

| Parameter                   | Description                                           | Type   |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| `pack:content:`             | Specifies the content of the **BYOS Edge OS** pack.   | map    |
| `pack.content.images`       | Specifies a list of OS images to use with the pack.   | list   |
| `pack.content.images.image` | An OS image to use with the pack.                     | string |
| `system.uri`                | The system URI specifies the location of BYOOS image. | string |

```yaml
pack:
content:
  images:
    - image: "{{.spectro.pack.edge-native-byoi.options.system.uri}}"
    # - image: example.io/my-other-images/example:v1.0.0
    # - image: example.io/my-super-other-images/example:v1.0.0

options:
  system.uri: example.io/my-images/example-custom-os:v1.4.5
```

## Usage

BYOOS enables you to use a custom OS for your Edge host. You can use this feature to customize the desired
specifications of your OS layer in the Edge host. You can reference the custom OS through the BYOOS pack.

To use a custom OS, you must include all the Edge artifacts and provider images required by the Edge Installer in the
custom OS. Refer to the [Build Edge Artifacts](../clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/palette-canvos.md) guide for steps on
how to create a custom OS that includes all the required components for the Edge Installer.

Select the BYOOS pack and fill out the required parameters during the cluster profile creation process. The `system.uri`
parameter specifies the location of the BYOOS image. Refer to the
[Build Edge Artifacts](../clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/palette-canvos.md) guide to learn how to create Edge
Artifacts.

<TabItem label="Non-Edge" value="Non-Edge">

## Prerequisites

To use the non-Edge BYOOS pack, you must have the following:

<br />

- A custom OS that you created. Refer to the
  [Build Edge Artifacts](../clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/palette-canvos.md) guide to learn how to create a custom OS
  for Palette.

## Parameters

The following is a list of parameters required when using the BYOOS pack.

<br />

| Parameter         | Description                                                                                                                                                       | Type   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| `osImageOverride` | The image ID used as the base OS layer. This is the image ID as assigned in the infrastructure environment the image belongs to. Example: `ami-0f4804aff4cf9c5a2` | string |
| `osName`          | The name of the OS distribution. Example: `rhel`                                                                                                                  | string |
