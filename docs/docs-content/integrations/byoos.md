# Bring Your Own Operating System (BYOOS)

The [Bring Your Own Operating System (BYOOS)](../byoos/byoos.md) enables you to use a custom Operating System (OS) with
Palette. Palette comes with several operating systems out-of-the-box, but the existing OS list may not meet all users'
needs.

Using your custom OS provides several benefits, including the ability to control your own dependencies, improve
performance, and ensure compatibility with your existing applications. With BYOOS, you can choose the OS that best fits
your needs, whether it's a commercial or open-source distribution, and integrate it with your Kubernetes clusters. The
BYOOS pack can be used with both Edge and non-Edge environments.

## Usage

BYOOS enables you to use a custom OS for your Edge host. You can use this feature to customize the desired
specifications of your OS layer in the Edge host. You can reference the custom OS through the BYOOS pack.

To use a custom OS, you must include all the Edge artifacts and provider images required by the Edge Installer in the
custom OS. Refer to the [Build Edge Artifacts](../clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/palette-canvos/palette-canvos.md)
guide for steps on how to create a custom OS that includes all the required components for the Edge Installer.

Select the BYOOS pack and fill out the required parameters during the cluster profile creation process. The `system.uri`
parameter specifies the location of the BYOOS image. Refer to the
[Build Edge Artifacts](../clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/palette-canvos/palette-canvos.md) guide to learn how to
create Edge Artifacts.
