Palette supports the open source Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) project
[Crossplane](https://www.crossplane.io/). Crossplane transforms Kubernetes clusters into universal control planes,
extending the Kubernetes API and enabling infrastructure resource provisioning and management across major
infrastructure providers.

These resources, called
[Managed Resources (MR)](https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/concepts/managed-resources/#managed-resource-fields) within
the Crossplane environment, are essentially Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that represent infrastructure
resources as native Kubernetes objects. Because they are Kubernetes objects, you can interact with them using standard
commands like `kubectl describe`. When users create a managed resource, Crossplane interacts with the infrastructure
provider API to request the creation of the resource within the provider's environment.

## Palette Provider

You can use the Palette Crossplane Provider to interact with the Palette API and create resources declaratively.

Refer to the [Palette Provider](https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers/crossplane-contrib/provider-palette/latest)
page for a complete list of managed resources and examples.

## Get Started
