Palette supports the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) software tool, [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), to provide
consistent CLI workflow support to multiple cloud providers.

Terraform organizes cloud APIs into declarative configuration files, allowing users to define their infrastructure as
code. Terraform validates configuration files and checks whether the execution plan for a configuration matches
expectations before deployment, and applies the changes to managed resources accordingly.

## Spectro Cloud Provider

Palette and Palette VerteX API can be used with the Spectro Cloud Terraform provider. The provider is available in the
HashiCorp Terraform registry and offers detailed
[documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs) on supported data sources
and resources.

### Release Notes

Information about the latest changes in the Spectro Cloud provider can be found in the
[release notes](https://github.com/spectrocloud/terraform-provider-spectrocloud/releases).

### Government Cloud Support

The Spectro Cloud Terraform provider supports deploying resources to government clouds that meet strict security and
compliance requirements:

- [AWS GovCloud](https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/) - To leverage the government partition, set `partition` as
  `aws-us-gov` when creating an
  [AWS cloud account](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs/resources/cloudaccount_aws).

- [Azure Government](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-government/documentation-government-welcome) - To
  leverage the government partition, set `cloud` as `AzureUSGovernmentCloud` when creating an
  [Azure cloud account](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs/resources/cloudaccount_azure).

### Modules

Two modules are available to help you provision Spectro Cloud infrastructure resources.

- [Palette Edge Native Terraform Module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/spectrocloud/edge/spectrocloud/latest)
- [Spectro Cloud Terraform Modules](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/spectrocloud/modules/spectrocloud/latest)

Refer to the
[Spectro Cloud Modules](https://github.com/spectrocloud/terraform-spectrocloud-modules#module-resources--requirements)
README file to learn more about supported provider versions and other essential requirements.
