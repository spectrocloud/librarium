The Palette Go Software Developer Toolkit (SDK) allows Go developers to interact with several public Palette APIs
through user-friendly client configurations.

The SDK comprises of two libraries:

- The [Palette API Go](https://github.com/spectrocloud/palette-api-go) repository contains API client models that are
  generated from Palette's public APIs.
- The [Palette SDK](https://github.com/spectrocloud/palette-sdk-go) repository leverages the Palette API Go repository
  to provide client configuration for interacting with Palette public APIs. Refer to the
  [client.go](https://github.com/spectrocloud/palette-sdk-go/blob/main/client/client.go) file for a complete list of
  client configuration options.

## Get Started

Check out the [List Clusters with Palette Go SDK](./list-clusters-sdk.md) example to learn how to install, configure,
and use the SDK. This guide provides instructions and sample code for listing the active clusters in your Palette
environment.
