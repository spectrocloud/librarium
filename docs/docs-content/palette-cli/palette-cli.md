The Palette CLI contains various functionalities that you can use to interact with Palette and manage resources. The
Palette CLI is well suited for Continuous Delivery/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines and recommended for
automation tasks, where Terraform or direct API queries are not ideal.

To get started with the Palette CLI, check out the [Install](install-palette-cli.md) guide.
