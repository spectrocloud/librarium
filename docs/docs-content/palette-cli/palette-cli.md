The Palette CLI contains various functionalities that you can use to interact with Palette and manage resources. The Palette CLI is well suited for Continuous Delivery/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines and recommended for automation tasks, where Terraform or direct API queries are not ideal.

To get started with the Palette CLI, check out the [Install](/palette-cli/install-palette-cli) guide.
