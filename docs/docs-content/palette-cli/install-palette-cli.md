2. Open up a terminal session on your local system.

3. Navigate to your default download folder. For Linux environments the default location is **~/Downloads**.

4. Move the binary to a folder that is part of your system's `PATH` environment variable. Use the following command to
   move the binary to the **/usr/local/bin** folder.

```shell
sudo mv ~/Downloads/palette /usr/local/bin/palette && \
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/palette

   a Palette self-hosted instance or Palette VerteX, replace the `--console-url` with your custom Palette URL.
