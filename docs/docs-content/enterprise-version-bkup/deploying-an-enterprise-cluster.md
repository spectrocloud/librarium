You have two options for installing Palette. You can use the Palette CLI to install a new self-hosted Palette instance or convert an existing single-node cluster (Quick-Start Mode) to a highly available three-node cluster. Select the method below that corresponds to your installation type.

- [Install With CLI](#install-with-cli)

- [Install With OVA](#install-with-ova)


<br />

:::caution


Starting with Palette 4.0.0, the Palette CLI, and the Helm Chart, are the only supported methods for installing Palette. The Palette OVA installation method is only available for versions 3.4 and earlier. Refer to the CLI tab below, or the [Kubernetes Install Helm Chart](deploying-palette-with-helm.md) guide for additional guidance on how to install Palette.

:::


<br />



## Install With CLI

You install Palette using the Palette Command Line Interface (CLI) that guides you for details to create a configuration file and a three-node enterprise cluster for high availability (HA). You can invoke the Palette CLI on any Linux x86-64 system with the Docker daemon installed and connectivity to VMware vSphere where Palette will be deployed. 


### Prerequisites


- An AMD64 Linux environment with connectivity to the VMware vSphere environment. 



- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) or equivalent container runtime installed and available on the Linux host.



- Palette CLI installed and available. Refer to the Palette CLI [Install](../palette-cli/install-palette-cli.md#download-and-setup) page for guidance.



- Review required VMware vSphere [permissions](on-prem-system-requirements.md#vmware-privileges).



- We recommended the following resources for Palette. Refer to the [Palette size guidelines](on-prem-system-requirements.md#self-hosted-configuration) for additional sizing information.

  - 8 CPUs per VM.

  - 16 GB Memory per VM.

  - 100 GB Disk Space per VM.


- The following network ports must be accessible for Palette to operate successfully.

  - TCP/443: Inbound to and outbound from the Palette management cluster.

  - TCP/6443: Outbound traffic from the Palette management cluster to the deployed cluster's Kubernetes API server.


- Ensure you have an SSL certificate that matches the domain name you will assign to Palette. You will need this to enable HTTPS encryption for Palette. Reach out to your network administrator or security team to obtain the SSL certificate. You need the following files:

  - x509 SSL certificate file in base64 format.

  - x509 SSL certificate key file in base64 format.

  - x509 SSL certificate authority file in base64 format. This file is optional.


- Zone tagging is required for dynamic storage allocation across fault domains when provisioning workloads that require persistent storage. Refer to [Zone Tagging](on-prem-system-requirements.md#zone-tagging) for information.


- Assigned IP addresses for application workload services, such as Load Balancer services.


- Shared Storage between VMware vSphere hosts.

<br />

:::info

Self-hosted Palette installations provide a system Private Cloud Gateway (PCG) out-of-the-box and typically do not require a separate, user-installed PCG. However, you can create additional PCGs as needed to support provisioning into remote data centers that do not have a direct incoming connection from the Palette console. To learn how to install a PCG on VMware, check out the [VMware](../clusters/data-center/vmware.md) guide.

  | **Memory** | The amount of memory allocated to each VM node instance.|
  | **Disk Size** | The size of the disk allocated to each VM node instance.|


  <br />


  The installation process stands up a [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster locally that will orchestrate the remainder of the installation. The installation takes some time.

  <br />

  Upon completion, the enterprise cluster configuration file named `ec.yaml` contains the information you provided, and its location is displayed in the terminal. Credentials and tokens are encrypted in the YAML file. 

  <br />

  ```bash hideClipboard
  ==== Enterprise Cluster config saved ====
  Location: :/home/spectro/.palette/ec/ec-20230706150945/ec.yaml
  ```

  <br />

  When the installation is complete, Enterprise Cluster Details that include a URL and default credentials are displayed in the terminal. You will use these to access the Palette system console.

  <br />

  ```bash hideClipboard
  ====================================
  ==== Enterprise Cluster Details ====
  ====================================
  Console URL: https://10.10.189.100/system
  Username: **********
  Password: **********
  ```


14. Copy the URL to the browser to access the system console. You will be prompted to reset the password.

  <br />

  :::info

  The first time you visit the Palette system console, a warning message about an untrusted SSL certificate may appear. This is expected, as you have not yet uploaded your SSL certificate to Palette. You can ignore this warning message and proceed.

  ::: 

  <br />

  ![Screenshot of the Palette system console showing Username and Password fields.](/palette_installation_install-on-vmware_palette-system-console.png)

<br />


15. Log in to the system console using the credentials provided in the Enterprise Cluster Details output. After login, you will be prompted to create a new password. Enter a new password and save your changes. You will be redirected to the Palette system console.
  

16. After login, a Summary page is displayed. Palette is installed with a self-signed SSL certificate. To assign a different SSL certificate you must upload the SSL certificate, SSL certificate key, and SSL certificate authority files to Palette. You can upload the files using the Palette system console. Refer to the [Configure HTTPS Encryption](/vertex/system-management/ssl-certificate-management) page for instructions on how to upload the SSL certificate files to Palette.


17. The last step is to start setting up a tenant. To learn how to create a tenant, check out the [Tenant Management](../vertex/system-management/tenant-management.md) guide. 

  <br />

  ![Screenshot of the Summary page showing where to click Go to Tenant Management button.](/palette_installation_install-on-vmware_goto-tenant-management.png)


### Validate

You can verify the installation is successful if you can access the system console using the IP address provided in Enterprise Cluster Details and if the Summary page displays the **Go to Tenant Management** button.

You can also validate that a three-node Kubernetes cluster is launched and Palette is deployed on it.

<br />

1. Log in to the vCenter Server by using vSphere Client.


2. Navigate to the Datacenter and locate your VM instance. 


3. Select the VM to access its details page, and verify three nodes are listed.


4. Open a web browser session, and use the IP address provided in Enterprise Cluster Details at the completion of the installation to connect to the Palette system console. Copy the IP address to the address bar and append `/system`.


5. Log in using your credentials.


6. A **Summary** page will be displayed that contains a tile with a **Go to Tenant Management** button. After initial installation, the **Summary** page shows there are zero tenants.
 



## Install With OVA

### Enterprise Mode

The Palette Enterprise Mode is a multi-node, highly-available installation of the Palette platform suitable for production purposes. Installation involves instantiating the on-prem platform installer VM and invoking the "Enterprise Cluster Migration" wizard. Please follow [these](deploying-the-platform-installer.md) steps to deploy the installer VM and observe the [monitoring console](deploying-the-platform-installer.md#monitor-installation) to ensure installation is successful. After a successful installation of the platform installer, proceed to enterprise cluster migration.

<br />

:::info

Deployment of an enterprise cluster is a migration process from the quick start mode. You may choose to deploy the enterprise cluster on day 1 right after instantiating the platform installer VM, or use the system in the quick start mode initially and at a later point invoke the enterprise cluster migration wizard to deploy the enterprise cluster. All the data from the quick start mode is migrated to the enterprise cluster as part of this migration process.

:::



1. Open the On-Prem system console from a browser window by navigating to https://&lt;VM IP Address&gt;/system and log in.


2. Navigate to the Enterprise Cluster Migration wizard from the menu on the left-hand side.


3. Enter the vCenter credentials to be used to launch the enterprise cluster. Provide the vCenter server, username, and password. Check the `Use self-signed certificates` if applicable. Validate your credentials and click on `Next` button to proceed to IP Pool Configuration.


4. Enter the IPs to be used for Enterprise Cluster VMs as a `Range` or a `Subnet`. At least 5 IP addresses should be required in the range for the installation and the ongoing management. Provide the details of the `Gateway` and the `Nameserver addresses`. Any search suffixes being used can be entered in the `Nameserver search suffix` box. Click on `Next` to proceed to Cloud Settings.


5. Select the datacenter and the folder to be used for the enterprise cluster VMs. Select the desired compute cluster, resource pools, datastore, and network. For high availability purposes, you may choose to distribute the three VMs across multiple compute clusters. If this is desired, invoke the "Add Domain" option to enter multiple sets of properties.


6. Add SSH Public key and optionally NTP servers and click "Confirm".


7. The Enterprise cluster deployment will proceed through the following three steps:
   * Deployment - A 3 node Kubernetes cluster is launched and Palette Platform is deployed on it. This typically takes 10 mins.
   * Data Migration - Data from the installer VM is migrated to the newly created enterprise cluster.
   * Tenant Migration - If any tenants were created prior to the enterprise cluster migration, which would typically be the case if the system was used in the quick start mode initially, all those tenants, as well as the management of any such tenant clusters previously deployed, will be migrated to the enterprise cluster.


8. Once Enterprise Cluster is fully deployed, the On-Prem System and Management Console should be accessed on this new cluster. The platform installer VM can be safely powered off at this point.
