Spectro Cloud provides a Postman collection for your convenience to help you interact with the Spectro Cloud API.

## Prerequisites

To interact with the API, you will need the following:

* [Postman application](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) v10.2.2 or greater.


* A base URL for the Palette API. The default Palette API endpoint is `api.spectrocloud.com`, but the base URL will be different for self-hosted Palette installation. Contact your system administrator to find your base URL.


* An authentication credential. 


## Authentication

Two forms of authentication are available to interact with the Spectro Cloud API:

* An Authentication header with a token value.  
or
* An API Key with an ApiKey value.

Learn more about [authentication methods](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/user-management/user-authentication) in Palette documentation.
