The [Kubernetes Dashboard](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard) is a general-purpose, web-based UI for Kubernetes
clusters. The dashboard provides a rich variety of functionality by wrapping around the
[kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) CLI. You can use it to perform the following operations:

- List and manage Kubernetes cluster resources.
- Deploy a containerized application to a host cluster.
- Troubleshoot deployed applications and resources.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
Use the <VersionedLink text="Spectro Kubernetes Dashboard" url="/integrations/packs/?pack=spectro-k8s-dashboard" /> pack to add the Kubernetes dashboard
to your cluster. The pack documentation page has instructions on how to configure and use the dashboard.
