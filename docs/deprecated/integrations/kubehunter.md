Kube Hunter is an open-source tool that hunts for security issues in your Kubernetes clusters. Itâ€™s designed to increase
awareness and visibility of the security controls in Kubernetes environments. Kube-hunter probes a domain or address
range for open Kubernetes-related ports, and tests for any configuration issues that leave your cluster exposed to
attackers. It can be run on a machine in the cluster, and select the option to probe all the local network interfaces.
