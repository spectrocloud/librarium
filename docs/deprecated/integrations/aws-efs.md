You can access information from an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) volume within a specific region, no matter
which availability zone it's in. The cluster can be distributed across availability zones instead of having it in one
location and replicating it multiple times.

Palette handles setting up the AWS EFS as a volume with ease when adding the PersistentVolume storage container. Palette
will dynamically provision the AWS EFS storage layer for the worker node.

## Versions Supported

<Tabs queryString="versions">

<TabItem label="1.4.x" value="1.4.x">

## Prerequisites

- Create the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that allows the driver to manage AWS EFS access points. The
  [Introducing Amazon EFS CSI dynamic provisioning](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/introducing-efs-csi-dynamic-provisioning/)
  blog provides information on `EFSCSIControllerIAMPolicy`.

- An AWS EFS file system is available. Check out the guide
  [Create your Amazon EFS file system](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/gs-step-two-create-efs-resources.html)
  if you need additional guidance.

- Create your EKS cluster using static provisioning. Static provisioning requires you to create a virtual private cloud
  (VPC), subnets, route tables, internet gateway and NAT gateways in the AWS console.

  You can use the same VPC or a different one for EFS:

  - Using the same VPC for EFS ensures EFS is reachable from your EKS cluster. We recommend using the same VPC because
    it doesn't require peering.

  - If you use a different VPC for EFS, you need to peer the VPC with the VPC on which the EKS cluster is
    running.<br /><br />

- The security group associated with your EFS file system must have an inbound rule that allows Network File System
  (NFS) traffic (port 2049) from the CIDR for your cluster's VPC.

## Usage

There are two ways to add AWS EFS to Palette:

- Add EFS as a base CSI layer in a cluster profile.
- Add EFS as an Add-on layer, which will create a new storage class using the AWS EFS file system.

### Policy Information

You must create a policy that allows you to use EFS from your IAM account. You can use the following JSON to create the
policy.<br /><br />

```yaml
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement":
    [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": ["elasticfilesystem:DescribeAccessPoints", "elasticfilesystem:DescribeFileSystems"],
        "Resource": "*",
      },
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": ["elasticfilesystem:CreateAccessPoint"],
        "Resource": "*",
        "Condition": { "StringLike": { "aws:RequestTag/efs.csi.aws.com/cluster": "true" } },
      },
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "elasticfilesystem:DeleteAccessPoint",
        "Resource": "*",
        "Condition": { "StringEquals": { "aws:ResourceTag/efs.csi.aws.com/cluster": "true" } },
      },
    ],
}
```

### Storage Class

Palette creates storage classes named _spectro-storage-class_. You can view a list of storage classes using this kubectl
command:

<br />

```bash
kubectl get storageclass
```

### PersistentVolumeClaim

A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a request made by a pod for a certain amount of storage from the cluster. It acts as a
link between the pod and the storage resource, allowing the pod to use the storage. You can learn details about a PVC,
as shown in the following output, when you use the `kubectl describe pvc` command.

<br />

```bash
kubectl describe pvc my-efs-volume
```

## Troubleshooting

Some basic troubleshooting steps you can take if you receive errors in your pods when mounting an Amazon EFS volume in
your Amazon EKS cluster are to verify you have the following:

<br />

- An Amazon EFS file system created with a mount target in each of the worker node subnets.
- A valid EFS storage class definition using the efs.csi.aws.com provisioner.
- A valid PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) definition and PersistentVolume definition. This isn't needed if you're using
  dynamic provisioning.
- The Amazon EFS CSI driver installed in the cluster.

The following list provides more specific details to help you troubleshoot issues when mounting an Amazon EFS volume.
CSI driver pod logs are also available to determine the cause of the mount failures. If the volume is failing to mount,
the efs-plugin logs are available.

<br />

- **Mount Targets:** Verify the mount targets are configured correctly. Be sure to create the EFS mount targets in each
  Availability Zone where the EKS worker nodes are running.

- **Allow NFS Traffic:** Verify the security group associated with your EFS file system and worker nodes allows NFS
  traffic.

  - The security group that's associated with your EFS file system must have an inbound rule that allows NFS traffic
    (port 2049) from the CIDR for your cluster's VPC.

  - The security group that's associated with your worker nodes where the pods are failing to mount the EFS volume must
    have an outbound rule that allows NFS traffic (port 2049) to the EFS file system.

- **Subdirectories:** If you're mounting the pod to a subdirectory, verify the subdirectory is created in your EFS file
  system. When you add sub paths in persistent volumes, the EFS CSI driver doesn't create the subdirectory path in the
  EFS file system as part of the mount operation. Subdirectories must be present before you start the mount operation.

- **DNS server:** Confirm the cluster's Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) uses the Amazon DNS server. To verify the DNS
  server, log in to the worker node and issue the following command, replacing `region` with your AWS Region:

  <br />

  ```bash
  nslookup fs-4fxxxxxx.efs.region.amazonaws.com <amazon provided DNS IP>
  <amazon provided DNS IP = VPC network(10.0.0.0) range plus two>
  ```

- **Permissions:** Verify you have "iam" mount options in the persistent volume definition when using a restrictive file
  system policy. In some cases, the EFS file system policy is configured to restrict mount permissions to specific IAM
  roles. In this case, the EFS mount helper in the EFS CSI driver requires the `-o iam` mount option during the mount
  operation. Include the **spec.mountOptions** property:<br /><br />

  ```bash
  spec:
    mountOptions:
      - iam
  ```

- **IAM role:** Verify the Amazon EFS CSI driver controller service account associates with the correct IAM role and the
  IAM role has the required permissions.

  Run the following command: <br />

  ```bash
  kubectl describe sa efs-csi-controller-sa -namespace kube-system
  ```

  You should see this annotation:

  ```bash
  eks\.amazonaws\.com/role-arn"="arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/AmazonEKS_EFS_CSI_Driver_Policy
  ```

- **Driver Pods:** Verify the EFS CSI driver pods are running. Issue the following command to display a list of
  controller pods and node pods running in your cluster:

  ```bash
  kubectl get all -label app.kubernetes.io/name=aws-efs-csi-driver -namespace kube-system
  ```

- **File system won't mount:** Verify the EFS mount operation from the EC2 worker node where the pod is failing to mount
  the file system. Log in to the Amazon EKS worker node where the pod is scheduled. Then, use the EFS mount helper to
  try to manually mount the EFS file system to the worker node. You can run the following command to test:

  ```bash
  sudo mount -types -efs -options tls file-system-dns-name efs-mount-point/
  ```

[Troubleshoot Amazon EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/eks-troubleshoot-efs-volume-mount-issues/)
guide.

## Terraform

You can reference the AWS EFS pack in Terraform with a data resource.

```hcl
data "spectrocloud_registry" "public_registry" {
  name = "Public Repo"
}

data "spectrocloud_pack_simple" "csi-aws-efs" {
  name    = "aws-efs"
  version = "1.4.0"
  type = "helm"
  registry_uid = data.spectrocloud_registry.public_registry.id
}
```
