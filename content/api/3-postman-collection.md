# Postman Collection

</Intro>

Spectro Cloud provides a Postman collection for your convenience to help you interact with the Spectro Cloud API.

To interact with the API, you will need the following:

* A base URL (https://api.spectrocloud.com/v1).
* An authentication method. 

## Authentication

Two forms of authentication are available to interact with the Spectro Cloud API:

* An Authentication header with a token value.  
or
* An API Key with an ApiKey value.

To learn more about these authentication methods, navigate to https://docs.spectrocloud.com/api/introduction.

## Import the Payload

After you set up authorization, use this URL to import your configuration:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spectrocloud/librarium/master/content/api/palette-apis.json.
