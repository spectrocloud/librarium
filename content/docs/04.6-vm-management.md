# Overview

Palette Virtual Machine (VM) Management provides a unified platform to manage both containerized and traditional virtualized applications. This solution allows organizations to onboard, deploy, manage, and scale VMs within the same cluster as their containerized applications. VM Management simplifies managing infrastructure, improves resource utilization, and removes the cost of having a hypervisor.

Palette VM Management achieves a Kubernetes-native experience through its Spectro VM Dashboard add-on pack, which provides a user-friendly interface to manage virtual machines.


# Use Cases

VM Management is particularly suitable in the following scenarios: 

<br />

- Organizations that want to remove their virtualization infrastructure due to an aging environment or to reduce costs. Using VM Management, legacy applications can run on virtual machines alongside modern, containerized applications. 


- Edge environments that have only a few virtual machines running and a hypervisor is not desired.


# Prerequisites


VM Management requires the following: 

<br />

- Palette version 3.3.0 or higher.


- Production virtual machines supported on bare-metal Kubernetes clusters deployed on Canonical MAAS. To learn how to configure MAAS and create MAAS clusters in Palette, refer to the [Install and Manage MAAS Gateway](/clusters/data-center/maas/install-manage-maas-pcg) guide. MAAS requires a Private Cloud Gateway (PCG).

If hardware virtualization is unavailable - such as with nested virtualization - although it is technically possible to run VMs on Kubernetes by setting the KubeVirt resource ``useEmulation`` to true, we do not recommend this approach.

# Feature Gates

KubeVirt has a set of features that are not enabled by default. The features are protected by a Kubernetes concept called feature gates, which are key-value pairs that describe Kubernetes features. For example, live migration and the use of HostDisk for virtual machine disk images are disabled in KubeVirt. 

You can enable feature gates directly in the Spectro VM Dashboard pack by editing the `kubevirt.kubevirtResource.additionalFeatureGates` parameter in the kubevirt manifest.  To learn more, check out the Kubernetes [Feature Gates](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/) documentation.

Palette VM Management enables these feature gates by default:

- LiveMigration
- Snapshot
- HotplugVolumes
- DataVolumes
