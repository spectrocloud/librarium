# Overview

Palette Virtual Machine (VM) Management provides a unified platform for managing containerized and virtualized applications. This solution, which requires a VM Management license, allows organizations to onboard, deploy, manage, and scale VMs within the same cluster as their containerized applications. VM Management simplifies managing infrastructure, improves resource utilization, and removes the cost of having a hypervisor.

Palette VM Management achieves a Kubernetes-native experience through its Spectro VM Dashboard add-on pack, which provides a user-friendly interface to manage virtual machines.


# Use Cases

VM Management is particularly suitable in the following scenarios: 

<br />

- Organizations that want to remove their virtualization infrastructure due to an aging environment or to reduce costs. Using VM Management, legacy applications can run on virtual machines alongside modern, containerized applications. 


- Edge environments that have only a few virtual machines running and a hypervisor is not desired.


# Access VM Management

To gain access to the VM Management solution, contact our sales team at [sales@spectrocloud.com](mailto:sales@spectrocloud.com). With this license, you will receive credentials and an endpoint URL to access the registry that stores the Spectro VM Dashboard pack. 

When you receive the credentials and URL, you need to register the pack in your environment. To learn how, refer to [Configure the custom pack registry in Palette](/registries-and-packs/adding-a-custom-registry#configureacustompackregistryonthepaletteconsole).


# Prerequisites


VM Management requires the following: 

- Palette version 3.3.0 or higher.


- Production VMs are supported on bare metal Kubernetes clusters deployed on Canonical MAAS. To learn how to configure MAAS and create MAAS clusters in Palette, refer to the [Install and Manage MAAS Gateway](/clusters/data-center/maas/install-manage-maas-pcg) guide.

<WarningBox>

If hardware virtualization is unavailable - such as with nested virtualization - it is technically possible to run VMs on Kubernetes by setting the KubeVirt resource ``useEmulation`` to true, although we do not recommend this approach.

# Feature Gates

KubeVirt offers certain features that require explicit enabling through the use of Kubernetes [Feature Gates](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/). Feature gates are key-value pairs that allow the toggling of specific features.

To enable KubeVirt feature gates, one can modify an existing KubeVirt custom resource and specify the desired list of features to be enabled. This can be done directly in the add-on pack by modifying the Spectro VM Dashboard manifest `kubevirt.kubevirtResource.additionalFeatureGates`.

Palette's VM Management enables the following feature gates by default:

* LiveMigration
* Snapshot
* HotplugVolumes

For further information on feature gates, please refer to the [KubeVirt user guide](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/operations/activating_feature_gates/).
