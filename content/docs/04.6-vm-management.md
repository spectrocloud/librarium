# Overview

Palette Virtual Machine (VM) Management provides a unified platform to manage both containerized and traditional virtualized applications. This solution allows organizations to onboard, deploy, manage, and scale VMs within the same cluster as their containerized applications. VM Management simplifies managing infrastructure, improves resource utilization, and removes the cost of having a hypervisor.

Palette VM Management achieves a Kubernetes-native experience through its Spectro VM Dashboard add-on pack, which requires a Palette VM Management license. Contact our sales team at [sales@spectrocloud.com](mailto:sales@spectrocloud.com) to gain access to Palette VM Management.

This add-on pack requires a Palette VM Management license. If you are interested in using Palette VM Management, contact support@spectrocloud.com to start using this solution. You will be provided with a URL and credentials to the registry that stores this add-on pack.

Palette uses KubeVirt to manage virtual machines in Kubernetes clusters. KubeVirt enables virtual machine workloads to run on top of Kubernetes in a Kubernetes-native way. 

KubeVirt extends Kubernetes with additional virtualization resource types using Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) API. KubeVirt also includes controllers and agents that provide virtual machine management capabilities on the cluster. By using this mechanism,the Kubernetes API can be used to manage virtual machine resources similar to other Kubernetes resources.

Paletteâ€™s VM Management solution allows administrators to configure out-of-the-box add-on packs, cluster profiles, and virtual machine templates that include commonly used operating systems. Administrators can also define their own VM templates to share with users and can import virtual machines from their VMware vSphere environment into Palette.



# Use Cases

Palette VM Management is particularly suitable in the following scenarios: 

- Organizations that want to remove their virtualization infrastructure due to an aging environment or to reduce costs.  


- Edge environments that have only a few VMs running and a hypervisor is not desired.

Palette VM Management allows users to run legacy applications on VMs alongside modern, containerized applications, and it provides a user-friendly UI for managing VMs.


# Requirements

Palette VM Management requires the following: 

- Minimum Palette version 3.3.0


- Production virtual machines supported on bare-metal Kubernetes clusters deployed on MAAS Cloud Providers with virtualization support.

<WarningBox>

If hardware virtualization is not available, such as with nested virtualization, it is technically possible to run VMs on Kubernetes by setting the KubeVirt resource ``useEmulation`` to true. However, Spectro Cloud does not recommend this approach.
