# Overview

Palette Virtual Machine Orchestrator (VMO) provides a unified platform for managing containerized and virtualized applications. This solution allows organizations to onboard, deploy, manage, and scale VMs within the same cluster as their containerized applications. Palette VM Orchestrator simplifies managing infrastructure, improves resource utilization, and removes the cost of having a hypervisor.

# Use Cases

Palette VM Orchestrator is particularly suitable in the following scenarios: 

<br />

- Organizations that want to remove their virtualization infrastructure due to an aging environment or to reduce costs. By using Palette VM Orchestrator, legacy applications and modern, containerized applications can be deployed on VMs. 


- Edge locations that have only a few VMs running, and where a hypervisor is no longer desired.


# Prerequisites

Palette Virtual Machine Orchestrator requires the following:

<br />

- Palette version 3.3.0 or higher.


- Production VMs are supported on bare metal Kubernetes clusters deployed on Canonical MAAS. To learn how to configure MAAS and create MAAS clusters in Palette, refer to the [Install and Manage MAAS Gateway](/clusters/data-center/maas/install-manage-maas-pcg) guide.


- VMs with Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) must have a StorageClass that supports ``ReadWriteMany`` (``RWX``) access mode for seamless live migration to a different node - either when triggered manually or during a Kubernetes upgrades.

  <br />

  <WarningBox>

  In environments that use nested virtualization, where VMs operate inside of VMs due to lack of hardware to host VMs, it is technically possible to operate VMs in Kubernetes by setting the KubeVirt resource ``useEmulation`` to true. However, we do not recommend this approach.

# Get Started With VM Orchestrator

To get started, review [Virtual Machine Orchestrator Pack](/vm-management/vm-packs-profiles) to learn about its components. 

Review [Create a VMO Profile](/vm-management/vm-packs-profiles/create-vmo-profile) and [Add Roles and Role Bindings](/vm-management/vm-packs-profiles/add-roles-and-role-bindings) to learn how to create the cluster profile and add roles and permissions that allow users to create and manage Virtual Machines (VMs). 

Palette VM Orchestrator provides various methods to quickly deploy VMs from out-of-the-box templates or from your organization's templates. To learn more about using and creating templates, review [Deploy VM From a Template](/vm-management/create-manage-vm/standard-vm-operations/deploy-vm-from-template) and [Create a VM Template](/vm-management/create-manage-vm/create-vm-template). 


# Feature Gates

Palette VM Orchestrator utilizes open-source KubeVirt as a component of the **Virtual Machnine Orchestrator** pack to manage VMs and enables the following KubeVirt feature gates by default:

<br />

- LiveMigration
- Snapshot
- HotplugVolumes
- VMExport
- ExpandDisks
- HotplugNICs
- VMLiveUpdateFeatures

KubeVirt offers other feature gates you may find useful and which you can enable using [Kubernetes feature gates](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/). To enable more KubeVirt feature gates, you can modify the ``kubevirt.kubevirtResource.additonalFeatureGates`` parameter in the **Virtual Machine Orchestrator** manifest.

For more information on KubeVirt feature gates, refer to the [KubeVirt user guide](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/operations/activating_feature_gates/).
