# Overview

Palette Virtual Machine (VM) Management provides a unified platform for managing containerized and virtualized applications. This solution, which requires a VM Management license, allows organizations to onboard, deploy, manage, and scale VMs within the same cluster as their containerized applications. VM Management simplifies managing infrastructure, improves resource utilization, and removes the cost of having a hypervisor.

Palette VM Management achieves a Kubernetes-native experience through its Spectro VM Dashboard add-on pack, which provides a user-friendly interface to manage virtual machines.


# Use Cases

VM Management is particularly suitable in the following scenarios: 

<br />

- Organizations that want to remove their virtualization infrastructure due to an aging environment or to reduce costs. Using VM Management, legacy applications can run on virtual machines alongside modern, containerized applications. 


- Edge locations that have only a few virtual machines running, and a hypervisor is no longer desired.

# Access VM Management

To gain access to the VM Management solution, contact our sales team at [sales@spectrocloud.com](mailto:sales@spectrocloud.com). With this license, you will receive credentials and an endpoint URL to access the registry that stores the Spectro VM Dashboard pack. 

When you receive the credentials and URL, you need to register the pack in your environment. To learn how, refer to [Configure the custom pack registry in Palette](/registries-and-packs/adding-a-custom-registry#configureacustompackregistryonthepaletteconsole).


# Get Started With VM Management

To start with VM Management, review [Packs and Profiles](/vm-management/vm-packs-profiles) to learn about components of the Spectro VM Dashboard integrated pack. Next, become familiar with the [Spectro VM Dashboard](/vm-management/vm-packs-profiles/vm-dashboard) and the web interface it provides to manage your VMs. Review [Create Spectro VM Dashboard Profile](/vm-management/vm-packs-profiles/create-vm-dashboard-profile) and [Enable the Dashboard](/vm-management/vm-packs-profiles/enable-vm-dashboard) to gain access to it. The dashboard provides various methods to quickly deploy VMs from out-of-the-box templates or from your organization's templates. To learn more about using and creating templates, review [Deploy VM From a Template](/vm-management/create-manage-vm/standard-vm-operations/deploy-vm-from-template) and [Create a VM Template](/vm-management/create-manage-vm/create-vm-template). 



# Prerequisites


VM Management requires the following: 

- Palette version 3.3.0 or higher.


- Production VMs are supported on bare metal Kubernetes clusters deployed on Canonical MAAS. To learn how to configure MAAS and create MAAS clusters in Palette, refer to the [Install and Manage MAAS Gateway](/clusters/data-center/maas/install-manage-maas-pcg) guide.

<WarningBox>

In environments that use nested virtualization, where VMs run inside of VMs due to lack of hardware to host VMs, it is technically possible to run VMs on Kubernetes by setting the KubeVirt resource ``useEmulation`` to true. However, we do not recommend this approach.

# Feature Gates

KubeVirt is a component in the Spectro VM Dashboard pack that extends Kubernetes with additional virtualization resource types. KubeVirt offers certain features that require explicit enabling through the use of Kubernetes [Feature Gates](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/). Feature gates are key-value pairs that allow the toggling of specific features.

To enable KubeVirt feature gates, one can modify an existing KubeVirt custom resource and specify the desired list of features to be enabled. This can be done directly in the add-on pack by modifying the Spectro VM Dashboard manifest `kubevirt.kubevirtResource.additionalFeatureGates`.

Palette's VM Management enables the following feature gates by default:

* LiveMigration
* Snapshot
* HotplugVolumes

For further information on feature gates, please refer to the [KubeVirt user guide](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/operations/activating_feature_gates/).
