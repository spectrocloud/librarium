## Air-Gapped Installation

You can install Palette in a VMware environment with no internet connection. Use the following resources to support an air-gapped environment.

# SAAS - Private Cloud Gateway(PCG)


Palette supports on-prem environments through the Private Cloud Gateway (PCG) component. PCG provides support for isolated private cloud or data center environments. When installed on-prem, PCG registers itself with Palette, allowing for secure communication between the SaaS portal and the private cloud environment. The gateway also enables end-to-end lifecycle management of Kubernetes clusters in private cloud environments directly from the SaaS portal.
