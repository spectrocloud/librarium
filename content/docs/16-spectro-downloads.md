# Palette Dynamic Artifacts


# On-Prem Artifacts

Spectro Cloud Palette allows its deployment to be done in-house within the customer’s enterprise IT infrastructure. As of now, we support customers’ on-prem VMware vSphere. Therefore, the palette artifacts for the On-Prem installation are included in this section.

## On-Prem Installer 

The Palette Quickstart and Enterprise Mode on-prem installations are highly available installations of the Spectro Cloud platform. Installation of these modes involves instantiating the on-prem platform installer VM and invoking the "Enterprise Cluster Migration" wizard.

# SAAS - Private Cloud Gateway(PCG)


PCG is Palette's on-prem component to enable support for isolated private cloud or datacenter environments. Spectro Cloud Gateway, once installed on-prem, registers itself with Spectro Cloud's SaaS portal and enables secure communication between the SaaS portal and the private cloud environment. In addition, the gateway enables the installation and end-to-end lifecycle management of Kubernetes clusters in private cloud environments from our SaaS portal. Currently, PCG installation is required for the following platforms:
