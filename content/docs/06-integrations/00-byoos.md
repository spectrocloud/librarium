# Bring Your Own Operatin System (BYOOS) 

Bring Your Own Operating System (BYOOS) is a deployment option that allows you to customize the operating system of their environment. 
This BYOOS feature optimizes infrastructure and streamlines workflow by enabling users to specify a host runtime operating system (OS), providing greater flexibility and control over their infrastructure. 

BYOOS empowers you to deploy your preferred OS to your environments and tailor them to your specific needs using various customization tools. 

Spectro Cloud offers BYOOS support for both Edge and non-Edge environments, allowing you to customize your environment's operating system (OS). You can reference the BYOOS pack in Terraform using a data resource, which can help optimize their workflow. 

Check out the guides to how to use BYOOS in Edge and Non-Edge.
