# RKE2 Overview

RKE2 is a fully conformant Kubernetes distribution that focuses on security and compliance within the U.S. Federal Government sector. To meet the Kubernetes security and compliance goals required by the U.S. Federal Government, RKE2 establishes the following:<p></p><br />

1. Provides defaults and configuration options that allow clusters to pass the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark v1.6 with minimal operator intervention.<p></p><br />

2. Enables Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2 (FIPS 140-2) compliance.<p></p><br />

3. Scans components regularly for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) using Trivy in the build pipeline.<p></p><br />

This next generation of Kubernetes Combined with the best of K3s and RKE1 features, RKE2 launches control plane components as static pods, managed by the kubelet instead of relying on Docker. Moreover, the embedded container runtime is containerd.

Palette has made using RKE2 simple by incorporating it as a Pack. With a few clicks, RKE2 can be set while creating a Palette-specific cluster profile. Once a cluster profile is created, users can deploy the RKE2-based, Kubernetes clusters through the Palette console.
