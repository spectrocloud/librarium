# Cloudanix

Cloudanix container security add-on detects threats and abnormal behaviors in Kubernetes clusters. The Cloudanix dashboard visualizes the following:
<br />

* Threats and anomalies in real-time
* Mapping the threats to workloads in containers, pods, nodes, etc.
* Associated events for the threats
* The command that initiated or created the thread
* The user who initiated the threat, and much more.

Users can initiate Jira workflows and target specific workloads, excluding containers, pods, or nodes, right from the Cloudanix Dashboard. This Helm Chart installs three Cloudanix services to enable container security capabilities. The services are listed below:
<br />

* inventory-service
* threat-service
* config-cron
