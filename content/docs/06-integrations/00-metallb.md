# MetalLB

MetalLB is a load-balancer implementation for bare metal [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) clusters using standard routing protocols. This pack is recommended for self-hosted cloud environments to help external services get an IP address when the service type is set as LoadBalancer. You can use a manifest-based pack or a Helm-based pack to configure and manage bare metal Kubernetes clusters.

MetalLB deploys a controller and a speaker. The speaker is deployed as a DaemonSet that runs on all nodes.


## Versions Supported

<Tabs>

<Tabs.TabPane tab="0.13.x" key="0.13.x">

## Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster running Kubernetes 1.13.0 or later that does not already have network load-balancing functionality.


- A cluster network configuration that can co-exist with MetalLB.


- Some IPv4 addresses for MetalLB to hand out.


- When using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), one or more BGP-capable routers are required.


- When using the L2 operating mode, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) traffic on port 7946 must be allowed between nodes, as required by the [Hashicorp memberlist](https://github.com/hashicorp/memberlist). You can configure other port as needed. 


## Parameters

The `addresses` parameter applies to the manifest-based MetalLB pack. You can provide multiple entries, but usually only one is needed.

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|---------------|-----------------|
| `addresses`| This can be a range of addresses or a CIDR address. Examples:<br />192.168.250.48-192.168.250.55<br />192.168.250.0/24 |

## Usage

The *lb-metallb* manifest-based pack supports direct configuration of a Layer 2 (L2) IP address set. The *lb-metallb-helm* Helm-based pack provides an L2 address pool.

<br />

### Manifest

Manifest-based MetalLB supports direct configuration of an L2 IP address set. You can set either a range of addresses or use CIDR format, such as `192.168.250.48/29`. A more advanced MetalLB configuration, such as Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing requires you to write your own manifests and add them to the Palette cluster profile.

The example shows the syntax used to set an address range.

<br />

```yaml
manifests:
  metallb:
    images:
      controller: ""
      speaker: ""
    namespace: "metallb-system"
    avoidBuggyIps: true
    addresses:
		- 192.168.250.48-192.168.250.55
```

<br />

### Helm Chart

Helm-based MetalLB default gives you an L2 address pool by default. It has two sections, `charts:metallb-full:configuration` and `charts:metallb-full:metallb`, as shown in the following examples.

Use the `charts:metallb-full:configuration` parameter section to set resource types that MetalLB supports. The pack default gives you an L2 address pool. To set up a more advanced scenario, you can use the other resource types provided in the pack. The pack includes a commented-out example for each resource.

<br />


```yaml
charts:
  metallb-full:
    configuration:
      ipaddresspools:
        first-pool:
          spec:
            addresses:
              - 192.168.10.0/24
            avoidBuggyIPs: true
            autoAssign: true

      l2advertisements:
        default:
          spec:
            ipAddressPools:
              - first-pool

      bgpadvertisements: {}
      bgppeers: {}
      communities: {}
      bfdprofiles: {}
```
<br />

The `charts:metallb-full:metallb` parameter section provides access to all the options of the base chart that installs MetalLB. You donâ€™t need to change anything unless you want to install MetalLB in Free Range Routing (FRR) mode. To use FRR mode, set the option to `true`, as the example shows. 

<br />

```yaml
charts:
	metallb-full:
		metallb:
			speaker:
				frr:
					enabled: true
```

## Troubleshooting

If controller and speaker pods are not assigning new IP addresses that you provided in the MetalLB pack, it is likely pods in existing deployments do not have the latest configMap file. 

Addresses you specify in MetalLB pack values go into a configMap called `config` in the `metallb-system` namespace. The MetalLB controller and speakers use the configMap as a volume mount.

Any changed IP addresses will get updated in the configMap. You can confirm this by issuing the following command.

<br />

```bash
kubectl describe cm config -n metallb-system
```

<br />
	
Since the controller and speaker pods are using a previous copy of the configMap, existing deployments are unaware of the changes made to configMap. 

<br />
<br />

To ensure updated addresses are reflected in the configMap, you need to restart the controller and speaker pods so they fetch the new configMap and start assigning new addresses correctly. Issue the commands below to restart the controller and speaker.

<br />


```bash
	kubectl rollout restart deploy controller -n metallb-system
	kubectl rollout restart ds speaker -n metallb-system
```


## Terraform

```hcl
data "spectrocloud_pack" "MetalLB" {
     name    = "lb-metallb"
     version = "0.13.5"

     name    = "lb-metallb-helm"
     version = "0.13.7"
