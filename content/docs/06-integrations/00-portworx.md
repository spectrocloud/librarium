# Portworx

[Portworx](https://portworx.com/) is a software-defined persistent storage solution designed and purpose-built for applications deployed as containers, via container orchestrators such as Kubernetes.

## Versions Supported

<Tabs>
<Tabs.TabPane tab="2.8.x" key="2.8.x">

* **2.8.0** 

</Tabs.TabPane>

<Tabs.TabPane tab="2.6.x" key="2.6.x">

* **2.6.1** 

</Tabs.TabPane>
</Tabs>

## Prerequisites

For deploying Portworx storage on vSphere environments, make sure to configure the following properties in the pack
* vsphereConfig
* storageType
* k8sVersion

## Contents

The default installation of Portworx will deploy the following components in the Kubernetes cluster
* Portworx
* CSI Provisioner
* [Lighthouse](https://docs.portworx.com/reference/lighthouse/)
* [Stork](https://github.com/libopenstorage/stork)
* Storage class making use of portworx-volume provisioner  

## Integrating to an external etcd

Starting Portworx v2.6.1, you can make use of presets feature to toggle between the available ETCD options.

By default, Portworx is set to use internal KVDB. You can integrate Portworx to an external etcd server by following the steps below.
1. Enable `useExternalKvdb` flag by setting it to true
2. Configure the external etcd endpoints in `externalKvdb.endpoints`

If the external etcd server is configured to authenticate via certificates, additionally you may want to setup the following
* Enable `externalKvdb.useCertsForSSL` flag by setting it to true
* Setup certificate related configuration in `externalKvdb.cacert`, `externalKvdb.cert` & `externalKvdb.key`

<WarningBox>
Make sure to follow the correct indentation style, otherwise certs will not be imported correctly and will result in Portworx deployment failure
</WarningBox>

## Using secrets for vSphere user credentials

Portworx pack values allows you to configure vSphere user credentials in two ways
1. Username & password (`portworx.vsphereConfig.userName` and `portworx.vsphereConfig.password`)
2. Secret (`portworx.vsphereConfig.userCredsSecret` is available with v2.6.1 and above)

If you chose the latter, make sure to create the secret in the target cluster manually or by making use of BYO manifest addon pack.
<WarningBox>
Until the secret is created in the cluster, Portworx deployments might fail to run. When secret is configured, reconciliation should recover Portworx.
</WarningBox>

Secret can be created using the spec below
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: px-vsphere-secret
  namespace: kube-system
type: Opaque
data:
  VSPHERE_USER: "b64 encoded admin username"
  VSPHERE_PASSWORD: "b64 encoded admin password"
```  
and this secret can be referenced in the Portworx pack values as
```
manifests:
  portworx:
    vsphereConfig:
      userCredsSecret: "px-vsphere-secret"
``` 

Make sure to follow the correct indentation style, otherwise certificates will not be imported correctly and will result in a Portworx deployment failure.
