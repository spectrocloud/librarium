# Create an App Profile

You can create as many App Profiles as needed to fit various types of workloads on your Palette Virtual Clusters. Each App Profile can contain multiple services, also called layers in the App Profile stack. You can also create multiple versions of an App Profile. For more information, visit [App Profile Versioning](/devx/app-profile/versioning-app-profile). 

Use the following steps to create an App Profile.


# Prerequisites

* A Spectro Cloud [account](https://www.spectrocloud.com/get-started/).
<br />

# App Profile Creation

To create an App Profile:

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com).


2. In App Mode, select **App Profiles** from the **Main Menu**, and click the **New App Profile** button. 


3. Provide the following basic information for your App Profile and click **Next**.


|         Parameter           | Description  |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|
|Application Profile Name | A custom name for the App Profile|
|Version (optional) | The default value is 1.0.0. You can create multiple versions of an App Profile using the format **`major.minor.patch`**.
|Description (optional)   | Description of the App Profile. | 
|Tag (optional)               | Assign tags to the app profile.|


4. Select one of the available services to start configuring your App Profile. Refer to [App Profiles](/devx/app-profile) for a list of available services. 


5. Provide configuration information for the service.


6. You can add more services to the App Profile as needed. To do this, click the **Actions** button next to the **Configure tier** pane. To rearrange layers in the profile, select a service and drag it up or down in the pane. Each service becomes a layer in the App Profile stack in the order shown in this pane.


7. When you've provided the required configuration information for services, click **Review**. Your App Profile is now created and can be deployed.  

# Validation

To validate your App Profile is available and ready for use, navigate to the **App Profiles** page, where you'll find all your app profiles listed. From this page, you can also edit and delete App Profiles in **Settings**.
