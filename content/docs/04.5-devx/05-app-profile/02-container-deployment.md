# Container Deployment

Containers run small microservices to large applications efficiently. They contain all the required executables, binary codes, libraries, and configuration files. As a result, containers are lightweight and portable with less overhead. To add a container tier to Palette Dev Engine App Profile follow the steps below.

<br />

# Prerequisite

* [Spectro Cloud Palette account](https://www.spectrocloud.com/get-started/)


## Add Container to App Profile

1. Login to the [Palette](/devx#quickstartwithpaletteappmode).


2. Select **App Profiles** from the left **Main Menu** and click on the **New App Profile** button at the top right-hand side of the main screen. 


3. Provide the wizard with the following information and click on the **Next** button after you have filled out the information.

**Basic Information: **

|         Parameter           | Description  |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|
|Application Profile Name | A custom name for the App Profile|
|Description (optional)   | Description of the App Profile, if any | 
|Tag (optional)               | Tags on a cluster group are propagated to the cloud/datacenter environments.|


4. **Add Service**: From the available services list, select **Container Deployment**. [Containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/) are methods of building, packaging, and deploying an application. A container includes the code, runtime, libraries, and all the dependencies required by a containerized workload. Container deployment deploys containers to their target environment. Review the [Palette Container Deployment](/devx/app-profile/container-deployment) to learn more about container deployment.


5. Provide the following information to the wizard:
  * **Container Name**: An unique name for the container deployment
  * **Registry**: Select the registry from which the image is to be extracted. If specifying a non-Docker Hub registry, ensure you provide the full URL of the image.
  * **Image**: Image of the container to be deployed
  * **Network Access:**
    * Private
    * Public
    * Port number to expose the container for external communication.  
  * **Environment Variables:** Environment variables can be specified as **Key-Value** pairs during the container deployment.  
     Example: <br />
       name: DEMO_GREETING <br />
       value: Hello from the environment 
  * **Volume:** To persist the data generated by and used by the container.
    * Name: Volume name
    * Size: The size of the volume in GiB
    * Mount Path:  The path to the volume <br />
     Example: <br />
    /var/local/spectro-docs

  * **Runtime Settings**: The command and arguments you define here will override the default command and arguments provided by the container image. <br />
    Example: <br />
       command: printenv <br />
       argument: HOSTNAME
 
 
6. Click **Review** the information and complete the app profile creation wizard. Deploy more tiers to the profile per user requirements, and Palette Clusters can be deployed using the deployed app profile. 




## Validation

1. Login to [Palette](/devx#quickstartwithpaletteappmode).


2. Select the **App Profiles** option from the left **Main Menu**.
