# Palette Dev Engine Registries

The Pack registry is a server-side application that stores and serves packs to its clients. Packs from a pack registry are retrieved and presented as options during the creation of a cluster profile. Palette supports the configuration of multiple registries.

## Default Registry
The default pack registry is Spectro Cloud's public pack registry. It consists of several packs that make it simple for a user to quickly create a cluster profile and launch a Kubernetes cluster with their choice of integrations. Spectro Cloud maintains all packs in the default pack registry, this includes taking care of upgrades in the pack registry whenever required.

## Custom Pack Registry
Users can set up a custom pack registry using a Docker image provided by Spectro Cloud to upload and maintain custom packs. Spectro Cloud provides a [CLI tool](/registries-and-packs/spectro-cli-reference) to interact with and manage pack content in the pack registry. Custom registries offer a mechanism of extending the capabilities of a platform by defining additional integrations.

Palette Dev Engine supports the following types of custom registries:

* [Helm Registry](/registries-and-packs/helm-charts): Visit here for more information on Palette Helm Registry
* [OCI Registry](/registries-and-packs/oci-registry): Visit here for more information on Palette OCI Registry
