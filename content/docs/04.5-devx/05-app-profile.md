# App Profiles

App Profiles are templates created with preconfigured services required for Palette Virtual Cluster deployment. App Profiles provide a way to drive consistency across virtual clusters. 

You can create as many app profiles as required. An App Profile can be created to meet specific types of workloads on Palette Virtual Clusters. For example, you may create a development app profile with Helm Charts, Manifest, different database applications, etc.
