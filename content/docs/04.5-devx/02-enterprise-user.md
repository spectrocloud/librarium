# Overview

You can use the Palette Developer Experience (PDE) to serve two common use cases: enterprise developers and individual application authors who want to deploy a containerized application without worrying about infrastructure overhead. 

Refer to the [Enterprise Users](#enterprise-users) section to learn more about enabling PDE for a large set of downstream users. If you are an individual application author, check out the [Individual Application Author](#application-authors) section to get started.

# Enterprise Users

To enable PDE for downstream users, start by reviewing the following resources.


1. Understand the difference between [Cluster Mode and App Mode](/introduction/palette-modes).


2. Create and Manage the [Cluster Group](/clusters/cluster-groups).


3. Allocate [User Quota](/devx/manage-dev-engine/resource-quota).


The next set of references are not required but good for Palette administrators to be aware of.

- [Enable Disk Backup on Virtual Clusters](/clusters/cluster-groups/cluster-group-backups).

- [Set Up Ingress for a Cluster Group](/clusters/cluster-groups/ingress-cluster-group).

- [Pause and Resume Palette Virtual Clusters](/devx/palette-virtual-clusters/pause-restore-virtual-clusters).

- [Resize Palette Virtual Clusters](/devx/palette-virtual-clusters/resize-virtual-clusters).


# Application Authors

Use PDE to deploy your containerized applications to Palette. Leverage Palette's free-tier offering of PDE to get started. Create your application profiles and deploy your applications to Palette in no time.


Use the following resource to get started with PDE today.

* Learn about [Palette's Free Tier Offering](/getting-started/palette-freemium).

* [Quick Start with Palette App Mode](/devx#quickstartwithpaletteappmode).

* Learn about [App Mode versus Cluster Mode](/introduction/palette-modes).

* Familiarize yourself with [App Profiles](/devx/app-profile).
