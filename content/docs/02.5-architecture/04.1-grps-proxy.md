# gRPC and Proxies

Palette uses [gRPC](https://grpc.io) to communicate between the management platform and the workload cluster. gRPC is a high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework. It is used to build distributed applications and services. gRPC is based on HTTP/2 and uses protocol buffers (protobuf) as the underlying data serialization framework. Refer to the [Network Ports](/architecture/networking-ports) documentation for a detailed network diagram and to learn more about the ports used for communication.

When gRPC is used with network proxies, the proxie servers may support gRPC or require additional configuration to allow gRPC traffic to pass through. The following table provides a summary of the different scenarios and whether or not the proxy server supports gRPC.


| **Scenario** | **Description** | **Proxy Supported** |
|:-------------|:----------------|:--------------------|
| gRCP with HTTP/HTTPS - No SSL bump| gRPC traffic is sent over HTTP/HTTPS and the proxy does not perform SSL bump. This is universally supported. | ✅ |
| gRPC with HTTP/HTTPS - SSL bump | gRPC traffic is sent over HTTP/HTTPS and the proxy performs SSL bump. Support vary by vendor. | ⚠️ |
| gRPC with [Squid](https://wiki.squid-cache.org) Open Source Proxy | gRPC traffic is sent over HTTP/HTTPS and the proxy performs SSL bump. Supported in some scenarios but require additional configuration. | ❌ or ⚠️ |


The following sections provide more information about gRPC and proxies.

## Proxy Support

Because gRPC is based on HTTP/2, any proxy server that supports the [HTTP CONNECT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/CONNECT) method can be used to forward gRPC traffic.
