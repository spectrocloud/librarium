# Overview

Palette VerteX is FIPS-enforced by default, incorporating the Spectro Cloud Cryptographic Module into the Kubernetes Management Platform and the infrastructure components of your target clusters. To learn more about our cryptographic library, check out [FIPS 140-2 Certification](/compliance#fips140-2).

If desired, you can allow the use of certain non-FIPS functionality in Palette VerteX at the tenant level. **Tenant Settings** provides toggles to allow non-FIPS-compliant add-on packs and non-FIPS features such as scans, backup, and restore. You can also allow importing clusters created external to Palette.
