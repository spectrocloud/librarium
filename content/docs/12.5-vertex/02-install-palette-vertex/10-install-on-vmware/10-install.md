# Install Palette VerteX on VMware vSphere

You install Palette VerteX using a Command Line Interface (CLI) that guides you for details to create a configuration file and a three-node enterprise cluster for high availability (HA) with the following resources: 

- 6 vCPU
- 12 GB memory
- 70 GB storage

You can invoke the installer on any Linux x86-64 system with the docker daemon installed and connectivity to the Palette console and the VMware vSphere where Palette VerteX will be deployed. 


# Prerequisites

- A Palette VerteX account and repository credentials. Refer to [Access Palette VerteX](/vertex#accesspalettevertex).


- Downloaded Palette CLI.


- An Ubuntu Pro Subscription. Ubuntu Pro provides access to FIPS 140-2 certified cryptographic packages.


- An Ubuntu Pro token.


- Kind installed locally. For more information, refer to the [kind installation](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation) reference.


- In VMware environments with internet connectivity, you will need to configure firewall ports to allow relevant traffic for Palette to function correctly. Refer to [Network Ports](/architecture/networking-ports/#self-hostednetworkcommunicationsandports) for a list of required ports that must enabled for inbound or outbound communication.


You can provide an optional SSH key pair to access the cluster remotely for maintenance and troubleshooting.

<br />

<InfoBox>

Self-hosted Palette installations provide a system Private Cloud Gateway (PCG) out-of-the-box and typically do not require a separate, user-installed PCG. However, you can create additional PCGs as needed to support provisioning into remote data centers that do not have a direct incoming connection from the Palette console. To learn how to install a PCG on VMware, check out the [VMware](/clusters/data-center/vmware) guide.

</InfoBox>


# Install the Enterprise Cluster

1. Download the Palette CLI. Refer to [Download and Setup](/palette-cli/install-palette-cli#downloadandsetup).


2. Log in to the vCenter Server by using the vSphere Client.


3. Navigate to the Datacenter and select the cluster you want to use for the installation. Right-click on the cluster and selectÂ **vertex-installer**. 


4. Click the **Power On** icon to create a Virtual Machine (VM) instance. The installer will provide a DNS name and IP address for the instance, which you will use to SSH into the instance. This may take a few minutes. 

![Screenshot of the DNS name and IP address displayed when a VM instance is created.](/vertex_installation_install-on-vmware_dns-and-ip.png)

<br />


5. Open a terminal window and SSH into the instance using the DNS name and IP address the vertex-installer provides. For example `ssh -i ~/.ssh/vertex_id_rsa ubuntu@10.10.139.195`.

```bash hideClipboard
ssh -i ~/.ssh/vertex_id_rsa <dns_name>@<ip_address>
```


6. Invoke the Palette CLI by using the following command. The installer prompts you for configuration details and then initiates the installation. For more information about the ``ec`` subcommand, refer to [Palette Commands](/palette-cli/commands#ec). 

```bash
palette ec install
```


  The first prompts to enable Ubuntu Pro and provide its token, enable FIPS, and provide the required repository URL and password will give you access to Palette VerteX.

  <br />

```bash hideClipboard
No palette CLI config file detected. One will be created.
Enable Ubuntu Pro: y
Ubuntu Pro token: *****
Enable FIPS? [y/N]: y
Spectro Cloud repository location: < repository_URL >
Spectro Cloud repository password: ****************
```

<br />

7. When prompted to enable Ubuntu Pro, type `y` and provide your Ubuntu Pro token. This enables the Ubuntu license.  


8. When prompted to enable FIPS, type `y`. The repository location is displayed. 


9. Enter the repository URL you received from our Support team.


10. Enter the repository password.


11. Choose ``VMware vSphere`` as the cloud type. This is the default.


12. Type an enterprise cluster name.


13. When prompted, enter the information listed in each of the following tables.

<br />

#### Environment Configuration


|**Parameter**| **Description**|
|:-------------|----------------|
|**HTTPS Proxy**|Leave this blank unless you are using an HTTPS Proxy. This setting will be propagated to all EC nodes and all of its target cluster nodes. Example: ``https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@PROXYIP:PROXYPORT``.|
|**HTTP Proxy**|Leave this blank unless you are using an HTTP Proxy. This setting will be propagated to all EC nodes and all of its target cluster nodes. Example: ``http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@PROXYIP:PROXYPORT``.|
|**No Proxy**|The default is blank. You can add a comma-separated list of local network CIDR addresses, hostnames, and domain names that should be excluded from being a proxy. This setting will be propagated to all the nodes to bypass the proxy server. Example if you have a self-hosted environment: ``maas.company.com,10.10.0.0/16``.|
|**Proxy CA Certificate Filepath**|The default is blank. You can provide the filepath of a CA certificate on the installer host. If provided, this CA certificate will be copied to each host in the PCG cluster during deployment. The provided path will be used on the PCG cluster hosts. Example: `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ca.crt`.|
|**Pod CIDR**|Enter the CIDR pool IP that will be used to assign IP addresses to pods in the EC cluster. The pod IP addresses should be unique and not overlap with any machine IPs in the environment.|
|**Service IP Range**|Enter the IP address range that will be used to assign IP addresses to services in the EC cluster. The service IP addresses should be unique and not overlap with any machine IPs in the environment.|

<br />

#### VMware vSphere Account Information

|**Parameter**                            | **Description**|
|-----------------------------------------|----------------|

|-----------------------------------------|----------------|
| **Search domain(s)** | Comma-separated list of DNS search domains.|


  The installation process stands up a kind cluster locally that will orchestrate the remainder of the installation. This will take some time.


  Upon completion, a new EC configuration file named ``ec.yaml`` is generated and its location is displayed in the terminal. Credentials and tokens are encrypted in the YAML file. 

<br />

```bash
==== Enterprise Cluster config saved ====
Location: :/home/spectro/.palette/ec/ec-20230706150945/ec.yaml
```

<br />

When the installation is complete, Enterprise Cluster Details that include a URL and default credentials are displayed in the terminal. You will use these to access the Palette VerteX System Console.

<br />

```bash
====================================
==== Enterprise Cluster Details ====
====================================
Console URL: https://10.10.189.100/system
Username: admin
Password: admin
```


15.  Click the URL to access the System Console. You will be prompted to reset the password.

<br />
  

16. Upon logging in, a Summary page is displayed. Click the **Go to Tenant Management** button to start setting up a tenant. To learn how to create a tenant, check out [](). 


![Screenshot of the Summary page showing where to click Go to Tenant Management button.](/vertex_installation_install-on-vmware_goto-tenant-management.png)

<!-- provisions a EC cluster in your VMware vSphere environment. The CloudAccount.apiKey and Mgmt.apiKey values in the ec.yaml are encrypted and cannot be manually updated. To change these values, rerun the installer using palette ec install. -->

<!-- If the deployment fails due to misconfiguration, update the ec.yaml file and rerun the installer. Refer to the Edit and Redeploy EC section below. -->


# Validate

You can verify the installation is successful if you can access the system console using the IP address provided in Enterprise Cluster Details and if the Summary page displays the **Go to Tenant Management** button.

You can validate that a three-node Kubernetes cluster is launched and Palette VerteX is deployed on it.

1. Log in to the vCenter Server using vSphere Client.


2. Navigate to the Datacenter and locate your VM instance, and select the VM to access its details page.


3. Power on the VM instance if it is not already on.


4. Verify there are three nodes listed.


5. Click **View all 6 IP Addresses** to display a pop-up box that presents three IPv4 addresses and three equivalent IPv6 addresses. 


6. In your terminal window, use the IP address provided in Enterprise Cluster Details at the completion of the installatation to connect to the Palette VerteX System Console.


7. Log in using the default credentials, and reset the password when prompted. 


8. A Summary page will be displayed that contains a tile with a **Go to Tenant Management** button. After initial installation, the Summary page shows there are zero tenants.



<!-- 1. Connect to the system console. 


2. Access the tenant, and navigate to the left **Main Menu** and select **Clusters**. 


3. On the cluster Overview page, verify the cluster health status. While the cluster is being deployed, the **Cluster Status** field displays **Provisioning**. When provisioning is complete, ensure cluster status displays **Running**. -->

# Next Steps

After you create the tenant, you are ready to configure authentication types in tenant settings and create users and teams.
