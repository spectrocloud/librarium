# Install Using Quick-Start Mode

Paletteâ€™s On-Prem Quick-Start mode is a single-node deployment of a self-hosted Palette instance in vCenter. This single-node installation is typically used for Proof of Concept (POC) deployments to quickly understand the capabilities of the Palette platform. It is not recommended for Production deployments but serves as a precursory installation for Enterprise mode.  

For production environments, you will migrate the single-node cluster you deploy in Quick-Start mode to Enterprise mode. Enterprise mode deploys two additional nodes to create a three-node highly available cluster. For steps on how to migrate the single-node cluster to Enterprise mode, refer to the [Migrate Cluster to Enterprise Mode](/vertex-edition/migrate-cluster-to-enterprise-mode) guide.

# Prerequisites

- Downloaded platform installer Open Virtualization Appliance (OVA) file using the link provided.


- Added port permissions to inbound rules for security groups to provide Palette connectivity and outbound connections. Refer to [Network Ports](/architecture/networking-ports/#self-hostednetworkcommunicationsandports) for a list of required ports that must enabled for inbound or outbound communication. 


- A new or existing SSH key pair to access the platform installer for any troubleshooting.  
 
# Install Palette


1. Log in to vCenter Server by using the vSphere Client.


2. Navigate to the Datacenter and select the cluster you want to use for the installation. Right-click on the cluster and select **Deploy OVF Template**.


3. Provide the OVA installer URL you received from our support team and click **Next**.

  You may get a warning message stating the certificate is not trusted. You can ignore this message and select **Next**.


4. Assign a name to the Virtual Machine (VM) and select the folder where you want to install the VM. 


5. Select a compute resource and click **Next**. 



6. Review the details page. You can click **Ignore** in the warning box about an untrusted certificate. Click **Next** when you are done.


6. Select your storage device and click **Next**.


7. Choose a network for your appliance. The installer requires an outgoing internet connection. Select a network that provides this access either directly or via a proxy. Click **Next** to proceed.


8. Fill out the remaining template customization options. Scroll to view all the options. If needed, you can modify input fields before completing the setup. <br /><br />

  ### General Settings

  <br />

  ### Kubernetes Cluster Settings

  | Parameter | Description | Default Value |
  | --- | --- | --- |

  | **Service cluster IP range** | CIDR notation IP range from which to assign service cluster IPs. This must not overlap with IP ranges assigned to nodes or pods. | `10.96.0.0/12` |

  <br />

  ### Monitoring Console

  | Parameter | Description | Default Value |
  | --- | --- | ---|
  | **Monitoring Console Password** | A password that gives access to the monitoring console after you power on the VM to view installation status and system logs. You can configure the password or use the default password `admin`, default username: `admin`. After powering on the VM, you can access the console at `https://<vm_ip_address>:5080`. You must append port ``5080`` to the VM IP address. | `admin:admin` |

  <br />

  ### Network Settings

  | Parameter | Description | Default Values |
  | --- | --- | ---|
  | **Static IP gateway** | Gateway IP address, such as 192.168.0.1, required only for static IP allocation. | - |
  | **Static IP DNS** | Comma-separated DNS addresses, required only for static IP allocation. | - |
  | **Static IP search domains** | Comma-separated search domains, required only for static IP allocation. | - |
  | **Static IP Address** | VM IP address to use only if you are using static IP allocation. If you are using default DHCP, leave fields blank. | DHCP |
  | **Static IP subnet prefix** | Static IP subnet prefix to use only if you are using static IP allocation. For example, `18`. | - |

  <br />

  ### Proxy Settings

  
  <InfoBox>
  
  Palette VerteX installations do not use a proxy. If you are installing VerteX, you can skip proxy configuration.

  </InfoBox>

  | Parameter | Description | Default Values |
  | --- | --- | ---|
  | HTTPS Proxy | Optional HTTPS proxy endpoint for outbound connections. | - |
  | NO Proxy | Optional comma-separated list of vCenter server, local network CIDR, hostnames, and domain names that should be excluded from proxying. | - |
  | Proxy Certificate | Optional certificate used by the proxy for encryption encoded in base64. | - |
  | HTTP Proxy | Optional HTTP proxy endpoint for outbound connections. | - |

  <br />

    ### Spectro Cloud Repository

  | Parameter | Description | Default Values |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | **Password** | Repository password. If you used the default earlier, type `admin`. | - |
  | **User Name** | Repository user name. If you used the default earlier, type `admin`. | - |
  | **Location** | Palette artifacts are retrieved from a public repository by default. If you are installing VerteX or in an AirGap environment, specify the dedicated artifact repository URL you received from our Support team. | - |
  | **Artifact Repo Certificate ** | Skip this for VerteX installations. This is optional certaificate for AirGap Environments. | - |


9. Click **Next** to complete the deployment wizard, review details, and click **Finish**. Upon completion, the The vSphere Client dashboard displays and the cloning process begins. Cloning takes just a few minutes to complete.  <br />

  
10. In the vSphere Client dashboard, select the folder that contains the VM to view cloning progress.


11. When deployment status displays **Completed**, power on the appliance.


12. When the virtual appliance IP address displays next to the VM instance, copy it to a new tab. In the new tab, add prefix `https://` and append port number `:5080`. For example: `https://10.10.189.125:5080`. <br /><br />

  You may get a warning message stating your connection is not private. You can ignore this message and select **Advanced**, then click the link to proceed.
  
  The On-prem supervisor console displays VM deployment status. Take note of the status for  **Spectro Cloud artifacts**, **Kubernetes configuration**, and **Spectro Cloud Installation**. This will take about 45 minutes. When processing is complete and status displays as successful, URLs for the On-Prem System Console and the Management Console are displayed.

# Validation

You can validate that a three-node Kubernetes cluster is launched and Palette Platform is deployed on it. 

<br />

1. Log in to vCenter Server using the vSphere Client.


2. Navigate to your Datacenter and locate your VM. Click on the VM to access its details page. 


3. Power on the VM.


# Next Steps

If you are installing for a production environment, you are ready to convert the self-hosted single node cluster to a highly available three-node cluster. Refer to the [Migrate Cluster to Enterprise Mode](/vertex-edition/migrate-cluster-to-enterprise-mode) guide.

If you are using the installation as a POC, you can now create gateways, cloud accounts, cluster profiles, and launch clusters using the management console. [Need a link here to Clusters docs].
