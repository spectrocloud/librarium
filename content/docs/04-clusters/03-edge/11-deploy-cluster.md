# Deploy Edge Native Cluster
Deploying an Edge native Kubernetes cluster requires all Edge hosts to be provisioned already with Kairos based immutable operating system. In cases where multiple edge hosts require the same configuration, it is challenging for the IT/Site operations team to ensure scale consistency in terms of OS and other configurations, such as networking, proxy, security, tooling, and user privileges. 

Setting up Virtual Machines (VMs) as Edge hosts and deploying the Edge native K3s cluster on those VMs is a less complex path to learning and gaining experience with Edge due to not having to connect to a physical Edge device. Here are the primary phases of deploying an Edge native Kubernetes cluster in production:  

- IT administrators prepare and test the edge installer ISO image for a consistent deployment at scale.

- Site operators provision edge hosts and identify the additional user-data to install on a set of edge hosts.

- Development team prepares a cluster profile using the provider OS image and the Infrastructure team deploys cloud native clusters.


For example, imagine you are an IT administrator for a retail company that has decided to expand to 1000 new stores this year. Your job is to deploy single-node Kubernetes clusters at the edge for each new store. Assuming all edge hosts have the same configuration, you must prepare an edge installer image and provision edge hosts so that the Development team can prepare a cluster profile and the Infrastructure team deploy a Kubernetes cluster on all those edge hosts.


In this tutorial, you will generate edge installer artifacts, create a Virtual Machine (VM) template, and provision VMs. You will then use the VMs as edge hosts to test the installer image's ease of use for consistent deployments and deploy the edge native K3s cluster.   

# Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial, you will need the following items:
<br/>

* A physical or virtual Linux machine with **x86** or **x86_64** (also known as **AMD64**) processor architecture.


* Minimum hardware configuration - 4 CPU, 8 GB memory, and 100 GB storage.


* Either one of Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 22.04, or openSUSE Leap 15.4 operating system (OS). 


* [Git CLI](https://cli.github.com/manual/installation) 2.30.x or later. 


* [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) 20.10.x or later. Ensure that you can create [privileged containers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#privileged) on your machine.


* A [Spectro Cloud](https://console.spectrocloud.com) account. If you have not signed up, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://www.spectrocloud.com/free-tier/).


* Tenant admin access to Palette to generate a new registration token for Edge hosts.


* VMWare vCenter server URL, login credentials, and names of the data center, data store, resource pool, folder, cluster, and network.




# Clone GitHub Repositories
Use the Linux machine as a development environment for generating edge native artifacts in this tutorial. Later, you will set up a Docker container as a testing environment to test and use the generated artifacts.

In your Linux machine, clone the [CanvOS](https://github.com/spectrocloud/CanvOS.git) repository containing the starter code. 
<br />

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spectrocloud/CanvOS.git
```
CanvOS repository follows [EdgeForge workflow](clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow) and leverages [Earthly](https://earthly.dev/) and Kairos to build all artifacts. 


Clone the [Tutorials](https://github.com/spectrocloud/tutorials.git) repository containing the starter code for building a VM template and scripts to provision/delete VMs. 
<br />

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spectrocloud/tutorials.git
```


# Edge Native Artifacts
This section will guide you to generate an Edge installer ISO image and Edge provider OS images. Referring to the [EdgeForge Workflow](/clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow), the diagram below shows the relationship between the Edge installer ISO, and Edge provider OS images.

![A diagram that displays the relationship between the three components  and how they relate to an Edge host](/clusters_edge-forge-workflow_edgeforge-workflow_components-diagram.png)


## Build Edge Native Artifacts
The steps below follow the [Build Edge Native Artifacts](clusters/edge/palette-canvos) guide. To get started, change to the **CanvOS** directory.
<br />

```bash
cd CanvOS
```

Checkout the **v3.3.3** tag.
<br />

```bash
git checkout v3.3.3
```

Next, open the **.arg** file in any editor you choose, and edit the value for the `CUSTOM_TAG` variable. You can enter your initials as the value. Ensure that it is made up of all lowercase alphanumeric characters. Palette Edge CLI will use this variable as a suffix in the provider image tags. The current example uses `demo` as a value.

<br />

```bash
CUSTOM_TAG=demo
```

Next, use the following command to create a **user-data** file containing the login credentials for edge hosts and a token to allow edge hosts to register themselves with Palette automatically. 


Before you issue the following command, you must have a registration token generated from Palette. If you do not have it already, you can log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com), and navigate to **Tenant Settings** > **Registration Tokens** > **Add New Registration Token** to create a new registration token. 

![Screenshot of a registration token in Palette](/tutorials/palette-canvos/clusters_edge_palette-canvos_registration-token.png)


Edit the `edgeHostToken` parameter value with the registration token copied from Palette, and issue the command below to create a **user-data** file. 
<br />

```bash
cat <<'EOF' > user-data
#cloud-config
stylus:
  site:
    edgeHostToken: aUAxxxxxxxxx0ChYCrO
install:
  poweroff: true
users:
  - name: kairos
    passwd: kairos
EOF
```

Lastly, issue the following command to build the artifacts. 
<br />

```bash
./earthly.sh +build-all-images --PE_VERSION=$(git describe --abbrev=0 --tags)
```

```bash coloredLines=2-2|#006622
# Output condensed for readability
===================== Earthly Build SUCCESS ===================== 
Share your logs with an Earthly account (experimental)! Register for one at https://ci.earthly.dev.
```

This command will take up to 15-20 minutes to finish.
<br />

## Verify Edge Native Artifacts
List the edge installer ISO image and checksum by issuing the following command from the **CanvOS** directory.
<br />

```bash
ls build/
```

Export the path to the ISO file, the **build/** directory, in the `ISOFILEPATH` environment variable. Later in the tutorial, you will use this environment variable to mount the **build/** directory to a Docker container. 
<br />

```bash
export ISOFILEPATH=$PWD/build
echo $ISOFILEPATH
```

List the Docker images to show two provider OS images, one compatible with lightweight Kubernetes (K3s) v1.24.6 and another with K3s v1.25.2.
<br />

```bash
docker images
```

Later in the tutorial, you will push these provider OS images to an image registry and refer those images in your cluster profile's **OS layer**. 

After generating Edge native artifacts, the next step is provisioning VMs to act as Edge hosts to test the Edge installer ISO image. This tutorial example uses VMWare vCenter to provision VMs.
<br />

# Provision Virtual Machines
In this section, you will set up a tutorials container as a testing environment to use the generated artifacts and pre-configured tools and scripts to provision VMs in VMWare vCenter.

## Create a Container
Change to the **tutorials/** directory.
<br />

```bash
cd tutorials
```

Use the command below to build the `tutorials` image. This Docker image is pre-configured with the necessary tools, [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) and [GOVC](https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/tree/main/govc#govc), for this tutorial. You will use Packer to generate a VM template and GOVC to communicate with VMWare vCenter. 
<br />

```bash
docker build --build-arg PALETTE_VERSION=3.3.0 --build-arg PALETTE_CLI_VERSION=3.3.0 -t tutorials .
```

Next, mount the directory containing your ISO file while provisioning a container from the `tutorials` Docker image you created above. Recall that the path to the directory containing your ISO file is stored in the `ISOFILEPATH` environment variable. 

Issue the following command to ensure the `ISOFILEPATH` variable has the correct path. 
<br />

```bash
echo $ISOFILEPATH
```

<InfoBox>

The environment variable set using `export [var-name]=[var-value]` will not persist across terminal sessions. If you have opened a new terminal session in your development environment, you will lose the `ISOFILEPATH` variable and have to set it again.  

</InfoBox>

After verifying the value of the `ISOFILEPATH` variable, issue the following command to create a container from the `tutorials` image and open a bash session into it.
<br />

```bash
docker run --name tutorialContainer --interactive --tty --volume "${ISOFILEPATH}:/edge-native/vmware/packer/build" tutorials
```

The command above will keep STDIN open, bind mount the directory containing your ISO file to the **/edge-native/vmware/packer/build** directory in the container, and 
allocate a pseudo-TTY to open a bash session into the tutorials container. 

## Create a Virtual Machines Template
In the tutorials container bash session, define a new file, **env_variables.sh**, to hold the environment variables to use later in the tutorial.
<br />

```bash
touch env_variables.sh && vi env_variables.sh
```

Save the following vCenter details in the **env_variables.sh** file. Enter values for all variables that are marked `"Enter a value"`. This file also creates the environment variables for Packer that should essentially be in the `PKR_VAR_[name]` format. 
<br />

```bash
#!/bin/bash
export vcenter_server="Enter a value"       # Example: vcenter.spectrocloud.dev
export vcenter_username="Enter a value"
export vcenter_password="Enter a value"
export vcenter_datacenter="Enter a value"
export vcenter_datastore="Enter a value"
export vcenter_resource_pool="Enter a value"
export vcenter_folder="Enter a value"
export vcenter_cluster="Enter a value"
export vcenter_network="Enter a value"

export PKR_VAR_vcenter_server=${vcenter_server}
export PKR_VAR_vcenter_username=${vcenter_username}
export PKR_VAR_vcenter_password=${vcenter_password}
export PKR_VAR_vcenter_datacenter=${vcenter_datacenter}
export PKR_VAR_vcenter_datastore=${vcenter_datastore}
export PKR_VAR_vcenter_resource_pool=${vcenter_resource_pool}
export PKR_VAR_vcenter_folder=${vcenter_folder}
export PKR_VAR_vcenter_cluster=${vcenter_cluster}
export PKR_VAR_vcenter_network=${vcenter_network}
```

Once the **env_variables.sh** file is ready, execute the following commands to declare the environment variables. 
<br/>

```bash
chmod +x env_variables.sh
source env_variables.sh
```

After declaring the environment variables, change to the **packer/** directory.
<br />

```bash
cd edge-native/vmware/packer/
```
This directory has a sample file, **vsphere.hcl.template**, containing the VM template name, VM configuration, and ISO file name to generate the VM template. Rename the **vsphere.hcl.template** to **vsphere.hcl** and review its content.
<br />

```bash
mv vsphere.hcl.template vsphere.hcl
cat vsphere.hcl
```

You *optionally* define the following custom variables in the **vsphere.hcl** file, if they differ from what you have already defined in the **env_variables.sh** file to meet your environment needs. 
<br />

```bash
# Custom Variables
vcenter_server   = ""
vcenter_username = ""
vcenter_password = ""
vcenter_datacenter      = ""
vcenter_datastore       = ""
vcenter_resource_pool   = ""
vcenter_folder          = ""
vcenter_cluster         = ""
vcenter_network         = ""
```

After reviewing the details in the **vsphere.hcl** file, use the following command to create a VM template using Packer.
<br />

```bash
packer build --var-file=vsphere.hcl build.pkr.hcl
```

The build process can take 7-10 minutes to finish depending on your machine's and network configuration.

```bash coloredLines=10-11|#006622
# Sample output
==> vsphere-iso.edge-template: Power on VM...
    vsphere-iso.edge-template: Please shutdown virtual machine within 10m0s.
==> vsphere-iso.edge-template: Deleting Floppy drives...
==> vsphere-iso.edge-template: Eject CD-ROM drives...
==> vsphere-iso.edge-template: Deleting CD-ROM drives...
==> vsphere-iso.edge-template: Convert VM into template...
Build 'vsphere-iso.edge-template' finished after 7 minutes 13 seconds.
==> Wait completed after 7 minutes 13 seconds
==> Builds finished. The artifacts of successful builds are:
--> vsphere-iso.edge-template: palette-edge-template
```

## Provision VMs
After the VM template is ready, clone it to provision VMs.

These next steps will use the [GOVC](https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/tree/main/govc#govc) tool built into the tutorials container to clone the template. Change to the **clone_vm_template/** directory.
<br />

```bash
cd ../clone_vm_template/
```

This directory has a sample file, **setenv.sh.template**, containing the environment variables for GOVC. Also, it defines the number of VMs to provision and a prefix string for the VM name. Most of the variables in the **setenv.sh.template** file already point to the environment variables you have defined in the **env_variables.sh** file, while you must provide a value for two of them - `NO_OF_VMS` and `VM_PREFIX`. 

Rename the **setenv.sh.template** to **setenv.sh**, and open this file in an editor.
<br />

```bash
mv setenv.sh.template setenv.sh && vi setenv.sh
```

provide a value for `NO_OF_VMS` and `VM_PREFIX` variables. The value for the `NO_OF_VMS` variable is set to create three VMs by default. If you have limited resources, just one VM is sufficient to complete this tutorial. The value for the `VM_PREFIX` variable should be alphanumeric and lowercase. 
<br />

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# GOVC Properties
# vCenter Endpoint
export GOVC_URL="https://${vcenter_server}"     # Use HTTPS. For example, https://vcenter.company.com
export GOVC_USERNAME="${vcenter_username}"
export GOVC_PASSWORD="${vcenter_password}"
export GOVC_INSECURE=1 #1 if insecure
export GOVC_DATACENTER="${vcenter_datacenter}"
export GOVC_DATASTORE="${vcenter_datastore}"
export GOVC_NETWORK="${vcenter_network}"
export GOVC_RESOURCE_POOL="${vcenter_resource_pool}"
export GOVC_FOLDER="${vcenter_folder}"
# Number of VMs to provision
export NO_OF_VMS=3
export VM_PREFIX="demo"
export INSTALLER_TEMPLATE="palette-edge-template"
```

Review and save the **setenv.sh** file, and execute the **deploy-edge-host.sh** script to provision the VMs.
<br />

```bash
./deploy-edge-host.sh
```

```bash coloredLines=7-7|#006622
# Sample output for one VM
Cloning /Datacenter/vm/sp-sudhanshu/palette-edge-template to demo-1...OK
Cloned VM demo-1
Powering on VM demo-1
Powering on VirtualMachine:vm-9919... OK
Getting UUID demo-1
Edge Host ID   VM demo-1 : edge-97f2384233b498f6aa8dec90c3437c28
```
The output on the terminal also displays the Edge host ID. VMs will use this host ID to auto-register themselves with Palette. 

## Edge Host Auto-Registeration
After provisioning, if you have correctly embedded the registration token in the ISO image, VMs will automatically register themselves with Palette. 

In Palette, navigate to the left **Main Menu** and select **Clusters** and switch to the **Edge Hosts** tab. 
You should see the VMs registered with Palette automatically.

![Registered](/tutorials/edge-native/registered_nodes.png)

## Push Provider Images
The next major steps are to create a cluster profile and deploy a cluster. However, before creating a cluster profile, you must push the provider OS images to an image registry and refer those images in your cluster profile's **OS layer**. 

Perform the following steps in the Linux machine where you built the Edge native artifacts. List the Docker images to show two provider OS images, one compatible with lightweight Kubernetes (K3s) v1.24.6 and another with K3s v1.25.2.
<br />

```bash
docker images
```

```bash coloredLines=3-4|#666666
# Output
REPOSITORY        TAG                       IMAGE ID        CREATED         SIZE
ttl.sh/ubuntu     k3s-1.25.2-v3.3.3-demo    b3c4956ccc0a    6 minutes ago   2.49GB
ttl.sh/ubuntu     k3s-1.24.6-v3.3.3-demo    fe1486da25df    6 minutes ago   2.49GB
earthly/earthly   v0.7.4                    d771cc8edc38     2 weeks ago    333MB
```

If you want to use these provider images in your cluster profile, use the following commands to push them to the *ttl.sh*  image registry. This registry is ephemeral; images will only be accessible for 24 hours. You can, however, use any other registry of your choice and tag the docker images appropriately before pushing them.
<br />

```bash
docker push ttl.sh/ubuntu:k3s-1.25.2-v3.3.3-demo
docker push ttl.sh/ubuntu:k3s-1.24.6-v3.3.3-demo
```

<WarningBox>

If you do not complete this tutorial example within 24 hours of pushing these images to *ttl.sh*, they will no longer exist and must be re-pushed.

</WarningBox>

## Create a Cluster Profile

Navigate to Palette, and switch to the **Default** project scope.

![Default Project Image](/tutorials/edge-native/default_project.png)


Navigate to the left **Main Menu** and select **Profiles** to list or create a new cluster profile. Click on the **Add New Profile** to open a wizard to create a new cluster profile.



Next, add the following custom content within the `options` attribute of the **OS layer** of your cluster profile.    
<br />

```yaml
  system.uri: "{{ .spectro.pack.edge-native-byoi.options.system.registry }}/{{ .spectro.pack.edge-native-byoi.options.system.repo }}:{{ .spectro.pack.edge-native-byoi.options.system.k8sDistribution }}-{{ .spectro.system.kubernetes.version }}-{{ .spectro.pack.edge-native-byoi.options.system.peVersion }}-{{ .spectro.pack.edge-native-byoi.options.system.customTag }}"
  system.registry: ttl.sh
  system.repo: ubuntu
  system.k8sDistribution: k3s
  system.osName: ubuntu
  system.peVersion: v3.3.3
  system.customTag: demo
  system.osVersion: 22
```
You must verify and change these attributes' values, as applicable to you, before using them in your cluster profile. 
<br />

The screenshot below shows custom content added to the OS layer of a cluster profile.
<br />

![Screenshot of k3s OS layer in a cluster profile](/tutorials/palette-canvos/clusters_edge_palette-canvos_edit_profile.png)

Select the **Profile** section in the left **Main Menu** to create a cluster profile that will combine the core infrastructure and add-on layers. Click on the **Add Cluster Profile** button, and provide the details in the wizard that follows. The wizard displays the following sections. 
<br />

### Basic Information
Use the following values in the **Basic Information** section. 

|**Field**|**Value**|
|---|---|
|Name|pack-tutorial-profile|
|Version|`1.0.0`|
|Description|Cluster profile as part of the pack tutorial.|
|Type|Full|
|Tags|`spectro-cloud-education, app:hello-universe, terraform_managed:true`|

Click on **Next** to continue. 
<br />

### Cloud Type
In the **Cloud Type** section, choose AWS as the infrastructure provider for this tutorial, and click on **Next** at the bottom to move on to the next section.   
<br />

<InfoBox>

If you choose a different cloud service provider, the core infrastructure layers options, as outlined in the **Profile Layers** section below, will differ from this tutorial.

</InfoBox>

<br />

### Profile Layers
In the **Profile Layers** section, add the following core infrastructure layers if you have chosen the AWS cloud service provider. To deploy your resource to Azure or Google Cloud, use the core infrastructure layers outlined in [Cloud Service Provider Configurations](https://github.com/spectrocloud/tutorials/tree/main/terraform/pack-tf/README.md#cloud-service-provider-configurations).

|**Pack Type**|**Registry**|**Pack Name**|**Pack Version**| 
|---|---|---|---|
|OS|Public Repo|Ubuntu|`LTS__20.4.x`|
|Kubernetes|Public Repo|Kubernetes|`1.24.x`|
|Network|Public Repo|Calico|`3.25.x`|
|Storage|Public Repo|Amazon EBS CSI|`1.16.x`|


```yaml
system.uri: 'ttl.sh/{{ .spectro.system.clusterprofile.infra.name }}:k3s-{{ .spectro.system.clusterprofile.infra.version}}'
```


As you add each layer, click on the **Next layer** button. After you add the **Storage** layer, click on the **Confirm** button to complete the core infrastructure stack. Palette displays the newly created infrastructure profile as a layered diagram. You can select any layer to make further edits or change the version if desired. 

Now you are ready to add the add-on layers. Click the **Add New Pack** button. 

Add the Spectro Proxy pack to enable a reverse proxy to connect to the cluster's API. Adding this pack is *optional*, but it will help connect your local machine to the cluster's API for debugging. 
Refer to the [Spectro Proxy](/integrations/frp/) guide for more details. 

|**Pack Type**|**Registry**|**Pack Name**|**Pack Version**| 
|---|---|---|---|
|Authentication | Public Repo| Spectro Proxy | `1.3.x`|

Click on the **Confirm & Create** button to finish adding the Spectro Proxy pack. Also, add the following certificate Subject Alternative Name (SAN) value to the Kubernetes pack under the `apiServer` parameter section to configure the Spectro Proxy pack.
<br />

```yaml
certSANs:
  - "cluster-{{ .spectro.system.cluster.uid }}.{{ .spectro.system.reverseproxy.server }}"
```
<br />

![Screenshot of the certificate Subject Alternative Name.](/tutorials/deploy-pack/registries-and-packs_deploy-pack_profile-certsan.png)

<br />

Next, add the following **Hello Universe** pack. This is the custom add-on pack you defined and pushed to the **private-pack-registry** earlier in this tutorial. 

|**Pack Type**|**Registry**|**Pack Name**|**Pack Version**| 
|---|---|---|---|
|App Services | private-pack-registry | Hello Universe | `1.0.x` |


Click on the **Confirm & Create** button to finish adding the Hello Universe pack. 


If there are no errors or compatibility issues, Palette displays the newly created full cluster profile. Verify the layers you added, and click **Next**.    


<br />

![Screenshot of the Profile Layers success.](/tutorials/deploy-pack/registries-and-packs_deploy-pack_profile-layer.png)

<br /> <br />


### Review
Review once more and click **Finish Configuration**  to create the cluster profile. 
<br />

## Deploy a Cluster
From the **Profile** page,  click on the newly created cluster profile to view its details page. Palette displays all the layers and allows you to edit any of them. 

Click the **Deploy** button to deploy a new cluster. The cluster deployment wizard will displays the following sections. 
<br />

### Basic Information
Use the following values in the first section, **Basic Information**. 

|**Field**|**Value**|
|---|---|
|Cluster name| pack-tutorial-cluster |
|Description| Cluster as part of the pack tutorial.|
|Tags|`spectro-cloud-education, app:hello-universe, terraform_managed:true`|
|Cloud Account|spectro-cloud|

Note that the AWS cloud account name in this tutorial example is **spectro-cloud**. If you used a different cloud account name, choose the name configured in your Palette's project settings. 

Click **Next** to continue.    

<br /> 

### Parameters
The **Parameters** section allows you to change the profile configurations. For example, clicking on the **Hello Universe 1.0.x** layer allows you to configure the `registry`, `repository`, and `tag` parameters defined in the **values.yaml** file. 
<br />

![Screenshot of the Cluster layers.](/tutorials/deploy-pack/registries-and-packs_deploy-pack_cluster-layers.png)

<br />

Keep the default values and click **Next**.

<br />

### Cluster config
In the **Cluster config** section, ensure the **Static Placement** field is unchecked. If checked, the **Static Placement** will deploy the cluster in an existing VPC, and you will need the [Amazon Resource Names](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html) (ARNs) for the existing subnets, roles, and other resources. For this tutorial, we will use dynamic placement, where Palette creates a new VPC and all other resources needed for the cluster. 

For the **Region** field, select the region of your choice. The tutorial example will deploy the cluster in the  **us-east-2** region. For the **SSH Key Pair Name** field, choose the SSH key pair name from the selected region. You must have an SSH key created already in the AWS region where you will deploy the cluster.

Click **Next** to continue.    

<br />

### Nodes config
In the **Nodes config** section, provide the details for the master and the worker pools. For this tutorial, you can use the following minimal configuration:

|**Field** | **Value for the master-pool**| **Value for the worker-pool**|
|---| --- | ---|
|Node pool name| master-pool | worker-pool |
|Number of nodes in the pool| `1` | `1` |
|Allow worker capability| Checked | Not applicable |
|Enable Autoscaler | Not applicable | No |
|Rolling update |  Not applicable | Expand First. <br /> Launch a new node first, then shut down the old one. |

Keep the **Cloud Configuration** the same for the master and worker pools.

|**Field** | **Value**|
|---| --- | ---|
|Instance Type | General purpose `m4.xlarge` <br />A minimum allocation of four CPU cores are required for the master node. |
|Availability zones | Choose any *one* availability zone.<br /> This tutorial example will deploy to the `us-east-2a` availability zone. | 
|Disk size | 60 GiB | 

Click **Next** to continue.    
<br /> 

### Settings 
The **Settings** section displays options for OS patching, scheduled scans, scheduled backups, and cluster role binding. Use the default values, and click on the **Validate** button.      

<br /> 

### Review
Review all configurations in this section. The **Review** page displays the cluster name, tags, cloud account name, node pools, layers, and an estimated hourly cost. If everything looks good, click on the **Finish Configuration** button to finish deploying the cluster. Deployment may take up to *20 minutes* to finish. 

While deployment is in progress, Palette displays the cluster status as **Provisioning**. While you wait for the cluster to finish deploying, you can explore the various tabs on the cluster details page, such as **Overview**, **Workloads**, and **Events**.
