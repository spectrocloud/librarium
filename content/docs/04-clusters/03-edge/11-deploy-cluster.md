# Deploy Edge Native Cluster
Deploying an Edge native Kubernetes cluster requires all Edge hosts to be provisioned already with Kairos based immutable operating system. In cases where multiple edge hosts require the same configuration, it is challenging for the IT/Site operations team to ensure scale consistency in terms of OS and other configurations, such as networking, proxy, security, tooling, and user privileges. 

Setting up Virtual Machines (VMs) as Edge hosts and deploying the Edge native K3s cluster on those VMs is a less complex path to learning and gaining experience with Edge due to not having to connect to a physical Edge device. Here are the primary phases of deploying an Edge native Kubernetes cluster in production:  

- IT administrators prepare and test the edge installer ISO image for a consistent deployment at scale.

- Site operators provision edge hosts and identify the additional user-data to install on a set of edge hosts.

- Development team prepares a cluster profile using the provider OS image and the Infrastructure team deploys cloud native clusters.


For example, imagine you are an IT administrator for a retail company that has decided to expand to 1000 new stores this year. Your job is to deploy single-node Kubernetes clusters at the edge for each new store. Assuming all edge hosts have the same configuration, you must prepare an edge installer image and provision edge hosts so that the Development team can prepare a cluster profile and the Infrastructure team deploy a Kubernetes cluster on all those edge hosts.


In this tutorial, you will generate edge installer artifacts, create a Virtual Machine (VM) template, and provision VMs. You will then use the VMs as edge hosts to test the installer image's ease of use for consistent deployments and deploy the edge native K3s cluster.   

# Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial, you will need the following items:
<br/>

* A physical or virtual Linux machine with **AMD64** (also known as **x86_64**) processor architecture. You can issue the following command in the terminal to check your processor architecture. 
  <br/>

  ```bash
  uname -m
  ```


* Minimum hardware configuration:
  - 4 CPU
  - 8 GB memory
  - 50 GB storage
 

* [Git](https://cli.github.com/manual/installation) version 2.30.x or later. You can check your git version using `git --version` command.


* [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) version 20.10.x or later. Using the ' docker version ' command, you can check the Docker Engine version. Ensure you can create [privileged containers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#privileged) on your machine.


* A [Spectro Cloud](https://console.spectrocloud.com) account. If you have not signed up, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://www.spectrocloud.com/free-tier/).


* Tenant admin access to Palette to generate a new registration token for Edge hosts.


* VMWare vCenter server URL, login credentials, and names of the data center, data store, resource pool, folder, cluster, and network.




# Clone GitHub Repositories
Use the Linux machine as a development environment for generating edge native artifacts in this tutorial. Later, you will set up a Docker container as a testing environment to test and use the generated artifacts.

In your Linux machine, clone the [CanvOS](https://github.com/spectrocloud/CanvOS.git) repository containing the starter code. 
<br />

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spectrocloud/CanvOS.git
```
CanvOS repository follows [EdgeForge workflow](clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow) and leverages [Earthly](https://earthly.dev/) and Kairos to build all artifacts. 


Clone the [Tutorials](https://github.com/spectrocloud/tutorials.git) repository containing the starter code for building a VM template and scripts to provision/delete VMs. 
<br />

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spectrocloud/tutorials.git
```


# Build Edge Native Artifacts
This section will guide you to generate an Edge installer ISO image and  provider OS images. Referring to the [EdgeForge Workflow](/clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow), the diagram below shows the relationship between the Edge installer ISO, and Edge provider OS images.

![A diagram that displays the relationship between the three components and how they relate to an Edge host](/clusters_edge-forge-workflow_edgeforge-workflow_components-diagram.png)




## Starter Code Repository
To get started, change to the **CanvOS** directory.
<br />

```bash
cd CanvOS
```

The files relevant to the current guide are in the **v3.3.3** tag. Check out the desired tag. You can check out a more recent and stable version if available. 
<br />

```bash
git checkout v3.3.3
```

Review the files relevant to the current guide. 
<br />

```bash
.
├── .arg          # Defines mutiple variables
├── Dockerfile    # Bakes the arguments to use in the image
├── Earthfile     # Series of commands for creating target images
├── earthly.sh    # Script to invoke the Earthfile, and generate target images
└── user-data.template  # A sample user-data file
```
<br />

## Modify the Arguments
Open the **.arg** file in an editor, and define a custom image tag for provider OS images. Skip this step if you use the default tag. The current example uses `demo` as the default tag. 
<br />

```bash
CUSTOM_TAG=demo
```

To change the image tag, edit the value for the `CUSTOM_TAG` variable. Ensure that it is made up of all lowercase alphanumeric characters. 

Suppose you want to edit the value of the image registry, image repository, OS distribution, Kubernetes distribution, or ISO file name. In that case, you can further edit the  **.arg** file to define the corresponding arguments. The table below shows the default value for all arguments defined in the  **.arg** file. 
<br />

|**Argument**|**Description**|**Default Value**| **Other Possible Values** |
|---|---|---|---|
|`CUSTOM_TAG`|Tag for provider image|demo|Lowercase alphanumeric string without spaces|
|`IMAGE_REGISTRY`|Image registry name|ttl.sh|Your image registry URL, without http or https <br /> Example: hub.docker.com|
|`OS_DISTRIBUTION`|OS Distribution |ubuntu | opensuse-leap|
|`IMAGE_REPO`|Image repository name|`$OS_DISTRIBUTION`|Your image repository name|
|`OS_VERSION`|OS Version, only applies to Ubuntu |22| 20|
|`K8S_DISTRIBUTION`|Kubernetes Distribution |k3s| rke2, kubeadm |
|`ISO_NAME`|Name of the Installer ISO|palette-edge-installer|String without spaces|

Using the default value for all arguments, the provider image name will be named similar to `ttl.sh/ubuntu:k3s-1.25.2-v3.3.3-demo`. Refer to the **Advanced** workflow in the [Build Edge Native Artifacts](clusters/edge/palette-canvos) guide to learn more about customization options, such as, updating the Dockerfile to install tools and dependencies and configure the host as needed.

## Create Registration Token
Next, create a registration token in Palette using the instructions available in the [Create Registration Token](/clusters/edge/site-deployment/site-installation/create-registration-token) guide. Copy the newly created token to a clipboard or notepad file to use in the next step. The screenshot below shows a sample registration token in the **Tenant Settings** > **Registration Tokens** section. 

![A screenshot of a registration token in Palette](/tutorials/palette-canvos/clusters_edge_palette-canvos_registration-token.png)

<br />

## Create User Data
Switch back to the **CanvOS/** directory in the Linux machine to create a **user-data** file that embeds the Edge host's login credentials and registration token in the Edge Installer ISO image.  


Issue the command below to create the **user-data** file for the current example. Before you issue this command, ensure to edit the `edgeHostToken` parameter value with the registration token you created in the last step. Also, you can click on the *Points of Interest* numbers below to learn more about main attributes relevant for this example.

EOF
```

</PointsOfInterest>
<br />

## Build Artifacts
Issue the following command to execute the **earthly.sh** file to build the Edge artifacts. The `--PE_VERSION` option in the command below signifies the Palette Edge version to use. The current example uses **v3.3.3**.
<br />

```bash
./earthly.sh +build-all-images --PE_VERSION=$(git describe --abbrev=0 --tags)
```

```bash coloredLines=2-2
# Output condensed for readability
===================== Earthly Build SUCCESS ===================== 
Share your logs with an Earthly account (experimental)! Register for one at https://ci.earthly.dev.
```

This command will take up to 15-20 minutes to finish.
<br />

## Verify Artifacts
List the edge installer ISO image and checksum by issuing the following command from the **CanvOS** directory.
<br />

```bash
ls build/
```

```bash
# Output
palette-edge-installer.iso      
palette-edge-installer.iso.sha256
```

Export the path to the ISO file, the **build/** directory, in the `ISOFILEPATH` environment variable. Later in the tutorial, you will use this environment variable to mount the **build/** directory to a Docker container. 
<br />

```bash
export ISOFILEPATH=$PWD/build
echo $ISOFILEPATH
```

List the Docker images to show two provider OS images, one compatible with lightweight Kubernetes (K3s) v1.24.6 and another with K3s v1.25.2.
<br />

```bash
docker images
```


```bash coloredLines=3-4
# Output
REPOSITORY        TAG                       IMAGE ID        CREATED         SIZE
ttl.sh/ubuntu     k3s-1.25.2-v3.3.3-demo    b3c4956ccc0a    6 minutes ago   2.49GB
ttl.sh/ubuntu     k3s-1.24.6-v3.3.3-demo    fe1486da25df    6 minutes ago   2.49GB
earthly/earthly   v0.7.4                    d771cc8edc38     2 weeks ago    333MB
```

## Push Provider Images
To use these provider OS images in your cluster profile later in this tutorial, push them to the image registry mentioned in the **.arg** file. The current example uses *ttl.sh* image registry. You can, however, use any other registry of your choice and tag the docker images appropriately.

Use the following commands to push them to the *ttl.sh* image registry. This image registry is ephemeral; images will be accessible for 24 hours.
<br />

```bash
docker push ttl.sh/ubuntu:k3s-1.25.2-v3.3.3-demo
docker push ttl.sh/ubuntu:k3s-1.24.6-v3.3.3-demo
```

```bash
# Output condensed for readability
3016c5078681: Pushed
6515074984c6: Pushed
k3s-1.25.2-v3.3.3-demo: digest: sha256:864c17f27d039e8930f42b1501d2c787877223e83f96f9f21b213f0ca9902169 size: 9286
```

<WarningBox>

As a reminder, *ttl.sh* is a short-lived image registry. If you do not use these provider OS images in your cluster profile within 24 hours of pushing to *ttl.sh*, they will no longer exist and must be re-pushed.

</WarningBox>

After generating Edge native artifacts, the next step is provisioning VMs to act as Edge hosts to test the Edge installer ISO image. This tutorial example uses VMWare vCenter to provision VMs.
<br />

# Provision Virtual Machines
In this section, you will set up a tutorials container as a testing environment to use the generated artifacts and pre-configured tools and scripts to provision VMs in VMWare vCenter.

## Create a Container
Change to the **tutorials/** directory.
<br />

```bash
cd ../tutorials
```

Use the command below to build the `tutorials` image. This Docker image is pre-configured with the necessary tools, [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) and [GOVC](https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/tree/main/govc#govc), for this tutorial. You will use Packer to generate a VM template and GOVC to communicate with VMWare vCenter. 
<br />

```bash
docker build --build-arg PALETTE_VERSION=3.3.0 --build-arg PALETTE_CLI_VERSION=3.3.0 -t tutorials .
```

```bash
# Output condensed for readability
Successfully built c1f605f04e85
Successfully tagged tutorials:latest
```

Next, mount the directory containing your ISO file while provisioning a container from the `tutorials` Docker image you created above. Recall that the path to the directory containing your ISO file is stored in the `ISOFILEPATH` environment variable. 

Issue the following command to ensure the `ISOFILEPATH` variable has the correct path. 
<br />

```bash
echo $ISOFILEPATH
```

<InfoBox>

The environment variable set using `export [var-name]=[var-value]` will not persist across terminal sessions. If you have opened a new terminal session in your development environment, you will lose the `ISOFILEPATH` variable and have to set it again.  

</InfoBox>

After verifying the value of the `ISOFILEPATH` variable, issue the following command to create a container from the `tutorials` image and open a bash session into it.
<br />

```bash
docker run --name tutorialContainer --interactive --tty --volume "${ISOFILEPATH}:/edge-native/vmware/packer/build" tutorials
```

The command above will keep STDIN open, bind mount the directory containing your ISO file to the **/edge-native/vmware/packer/build** directory in the container, and 
allocate a pseudo-TTY to open a bash session into the tutorials container. 

## Create a Virtual Machine Template
In the tutorials container bash session, define a new file, **.env**, to hold the environment variables to use later in the tutorial.
<br />

```bash
touch .env && vi .env
```

Save the following vCenter environment details in the **.env** file. Enter values for all variables that are marked `"Enter a value"`. This file also creates Packer environment variables, in the `PKR_VAR_[name]` format, pointing to the default environment variables. 
<br />

```bash
export vcenter_server="Enter a value"       # Example: vcenter.spectrocloud.dev
export vcenter_username="Enter a value"
export vcenter_password="Enter a value"
export vcenter_datacenter="Enter a value"
export vcenter_datastore="Enter a value"
export vcenter_resource_pool="Enter a value"
export vcenter_folder="Enter a value"
export vcenter_cluster="Enter a value"
export vcenter_network="Enter a value"

export PKR_VAR_vcenter_server=${vcenter_server}
export PKR_VAR_vcenter_username=${vcenter_username}
export PKR_VAR_vcenter_password=${vcenter_password}
export PKR_VAR_vcenter_datacenter=${vcenter_datacenter}
export PKR_VAR_vcenter_datastore=${vcenter_datastore}
export PKR_VAR_vcenter_resource_pool=${vcenter_resource_pool}
export PKR_VAR_vcenter_folder=${vcenter_folder}
export PKR_VAR_vcenter_cluster=${vcenter_cluster}
export PKR_VAR_vcenter_network=${vcenter_network}
```

Once the **.env** file is ready, execute the following commands to source the environment variables. 
<br/>

```bash
source .env
```

After declaring the environment variables, change to the **packer/** directory.
<br />

```bash
cd edge-native/vmware/packer/
```
This directory has the following files required for Packer build.  
<br />

```bash
.
├── build
│   ├── palette-edge-installer.iso
│   └── palette-edge-installer.iso.sha256
├── build.pkr.hcl
└── vsphere.hcl
```

Packer uses the environment variables you have defined in the **.env** file above. If your target environment differs from what you have already defined in the **.env** file, you can redefine those variables in the **vsphere.hcl** file again. Below is the default file content. It contains the VM template name, VM configuration, and ISO file name from the previous steps. 

Review **vsphere.hcl** file content.
<br />

```bash
# Virtual Machine Settings
########### DO NOT EDIT #################
# VM Template Name
vm_name          = "palette-edge-template"

# VM Settings
vm_guest_os_type        = "ubuntu64Guest"
vm_version              = 14
vm_firmware             = "bios"
vm_cdrom_type           = "sata"
vm_cpu_sockets          = 4
vm_cpu_cores            = 1
vm_mem_size             = 8192
vm_disk_size            = 51200
thin_provision          = true
disk_eagerly_scrub      = false
vm_disk_controller_type = ["pvscsi"]
vm_network_card         = "vmxnet3"
vm_boot_wait            = "5s"


# ISO Objects
iso                 = "build/palette-edge-installer.iso"
iso_checksum        = "build/palette-edge-installer.iso.sha256"
```

After reviewing and verifying the details in the **vsphere.hcl** file, use the following command to create a VM template using Packer. In this command, `--var-file` option is used to input the file containing the variable, and `-force` flag to destroy the existing template, if any. 
<br />

```bash
packer build -force --var-file=vsphere.hcl build.pkr.hcl
```

The build process can take up to 7-10 minutes to finish depending on your machine's and network configuration. After the build process is successful, it will create a VM template in the VMWare vCenter data store. 

```bash coloredLines=10-11
# Sample output
==> vsphere-iso.edge-template: Power on VM...
    vsphere-iso.edge-template: Please shutdown virtual machine within 10m0s.
==> vsphere-iso.edge-template: Deleting Floppy drives...
==> vsphere-iso.edge-template: Eject CD-ROM drives...
==> vsphere-iso.edge-template: Deleting CD-ROM drives...
==> vsphere-iso.edge-template: Convert VM into template...
Build 'vsphere-iso.edge-template' finished after 7 minutes 13 seconds.
==> Wait completed after 7 minutes 13 seconds
==> Builds finished. The artifacts of successful builds are:
--> vsphere-iso.edge-template: palette-edge-template
```

## Provision VMs
Once the VM template is ready, clone it to provision as many VMs as you need. The next steps will use the [GOVC](https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/tree/main/govc#govc) tool built into the tutorials container to clone the VM template. 

Change to the **clone_vm_template/** directory.
<br />

```bash
cd ../clone_vm_template/
```

This directory contains a sample file, **setenv.sh.template**, that declares the GOVC environment variables for the target vCenter environment, the number of VMs to provision, a prefix string for the VM name, and the VM template name. 

Most of the GOVC environment variables point to the default environment variables you have defined in the **.env** file above. However, you must provide a value for the number of VMs to provision and a prefix string for the VM name. Use the following command to rename the **setenv.sh.template** to **setenv.sh**, and open this file in an editor to provide a value for `NO_OF_VMS` and `VM_PREFIX` variables. 
<br />

```bash
mv setenv.sh.template setenv.sh && vi setenv.sh
```

The value for the `NO_OF_VMS` variable is set to create three VMs by default. If you have limited resources, just one VM is sufficient to complete this tutorial. The value for the `VM_PREFIX` variable should be alphanumeric and lowercase. 
<br />

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# GOVC environment variables
# vCenter Endpoint
export GOVC_URL="https://${vcenter_server}"     # Use HTTPS. For example, https://vcenter.company.com
export GOVC_USERNAME="${vcenter_username}"
export GOVC_PASSWORD="${vcenter_password}"
export GOVC_INSECURE=1 #1 if insecure
export GOVC_DATACENTER="${vcenter_datacenter}"
export GOVC_DATASTORE="${vcenter_datastore}"
export GOVC_NETWORK="${vcenter_network}"
export GOVC_RESOURCE_POOL="${vcenter_resource_pool}"
export GOVC_FOLDER="${vcenter_folder}"
# Number of VMs to provision
export NO_OF_VMS=3
export VM_PREFIX="demo"
export INSTALLER_TEMPLATE="palette-edge-template"
```

Review and save the **setenv.sh** file, and execute the **deploy-edge-host.sh** script to provision the VMs.
<br />

```bash
./deploy-edge-host.sh
```

```bash coloredLines=7-7
# Sample output for one VM
Cloning /Datacenter/vm/sp-sudhanshu/palette-edge-template to demo-1...OK
Cloned VM demo-1
Powering on VM demo-1
Powering on VirtualMachine:vm-9919... OK
Getting UUID demo-1
Edge Host ID   VM demo-1 : edge-97f2384233b498f6aa8dec90c3437c28
```
The output on the terminal also displays the Edge host ID. VMs will use this host ID to auto-register themselves with Palette. 

<InfoBox>

Copy the Edge host ID for future reference and manual registration if the auto registration does not work later in this tutorial. 

</InfoBox>

## Verify Host's Registeration
After provisioning, if you have correctly embedded the registration token in the ISO image, VMs will automatically register themselves with Palette. 

Log back into Palette, and navigate to the left **Main Menu** > **Clusters** > **Edge Hosts** tab. You should see the VMs registered with Palette automatically.

![A screenshot showing the VMs registered with Palette automatically. ](/tutorials/edge-native/clusters_edge_palette-canvos_edge-hosts.png)

<InfoBox>

For any reason, if you do not see your Edge hosts registered with Palette automatically, you can register the hosts using the Edge host ID manually. Click on the **Add Edge Hosts** button, and paste the Edge host ID returned after issuing the `./deploy-edge-host.sh` command in one of the previous steps.

</InfoBox>

## Create a Cluster Profile
Switch to the **Default** project scope for creating a cluster profile.  
<br />

![A screenshot of the Palette Default scope.](/tutorials/deploy-pack/registries-and-packs_deploy-pack_default-scope.png)

<br />

Select the **Profile** section in the left **Main Menu** to create a cluster profile made up of the core infrastructure layers and a manifest of a sample Kubernetes application, [Hello Universe](https://github.com/spectrocloud/hello-universe#hello-universe). 


Click on the **Add Cluster Profile** button, and provide the details in the wizard that follows. The wizard displays the following sections. 
<br />

### Basic Information
Use the following values in the **Basic Information** section. 

|**Field**|**Value**|
|---|---|
|Name|docs-ubuntu-k3s|
|Version|`1.0.0`|
|Description|Cluster profile as part of the edge cluster deployment tutorial.|
|Type|Full|
|Tags|`spectro-cloud-education, app:hello-universe, terraform_managed:false`|

Click on **Next** to continue. 
<br />


### Cloud Type
In the **Cloud Type** section, choose **Edge Native** as the infrastructure provider for this tutorial, and click on **Next** at the bottom to move on to the next section.   
<br />

### Profile Layers
In the **Profile Layers** section, first add the following OS layer.

|**Pack Type**|**Registry**|**Pack Name**|**Pack Version**| 
|---|---|---|---|
|OS|Public Repo|BYOS Edge OS|`1.0.0`|

To use one of the provider OS images you pushed to the *ttl.sh* image registry earlier in this tutorial, add the following custom content within the `options` attribute of the **OS layer**.    
<br />

```yaml
options:
  system.uri: "{{ .spectro.pack.edge-native-byoi.options.system.registry }}/{{ .spectro.pack.edge-native-byoi.options.system.repo }}:{{ .spectro.pack.edge-native-byoi.options.system.k8sDistribution }}-{{ .spectro.system.kubernetes.version }}-{{ .spectro.pack.edge-native-byoi.options.system.peVersion }}-{{ .spectro.pack.edge-native-byoi.options.system.customTag }}"
  system.registry: ttl.sh
  system.repo: ubuntu
  system.k8sDistribution: k3s
  system.osName: ubuntu
  system.peVersion: v3.3.3
  system.customTag: demo
  system.osVersion: 22
```
The values of the parameters above should be as same as the values defined in the arguments defined in the  **.arg** file while generating the Edge artifacts earlier in this tutorial. You must verify and change these attributes' values, as applicable to you, before using them in your cluster profile. 
<br />

<WarningBox>

As a second reminder, *ttl.sh* is a short-lived image registry. If you do not use the provider OS images in your cluster profile within 24 hours of pushing to *ttl.sh*, they will no longer exist and must be re-pushed.

</WarningBox>
<br />

The screenshot below shows custom content added to the OS layer of a cluster profile.
<br />

![A screenshot of k3s OS layer in a cluster profile.](/tutorials/edge-native/clusters_edge_palette-canvos_edit-profile.png)


Click on the **Next layer** button to add remaining core layers, Kubernetes and Network. 


|**Pack Type**|**Registry**|**Pack Name**|**Pack Version**| 
|---|---|---|---|
|Kubernetes|Public Repo|Palette Optimized K3S|`1.25.x`|
|Network|Public Repo|Calico|`3.25.x`|


As you add each layer, click on the **Next layer** button. After you add the **Network** layer, click on the **Confirm** button to complete the core infrastructure stack. Palette displays the newly created infrastructure profile as a layered diagram. 


Next, click on the **Add Manifest** button to add the *Hello Universe* application manifest.  

![A screenshot of the add Manifest button.](/tutorials/edge-native/clusters_edge_palette-canvos_add-manifest.png)

Use the following values to add the manifest metadata.  

|**Field** |**Value**|
|---|---|
|Layer name| hello-universe|
|Layer values (Optional)|Leave default|
|Install order (Optional)|Leave default|
|Manifests|hello-universe|

Entering `hello-universe` file name in the **Manifest** field will open a blank file in Palette's text editor. Copy the following manifest and paste it in Palette's text editor. The manifest below defines two Kubernetes objects:
1. **Deployment**: 
It pulls a public image, **ghcr.io/spectrocloud/hello-universe:1.0.12**,  and creates a ReplicaSet to bring up two pods running the `hello-universe` application.

2. **Service**: It uses NodePort to expose the `hello-universe` application running on each Node at a random port between 30000-32767. 


```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello-universe-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: hello-universe
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 8080
    targetPort: 8080

Click on the **Confirm & Create** button to finish adding the manifest. If there are no errors or compatibility issues, Palette displays the newly created full cluster profile. Verify the layers you added, and click **Next**. 



### Review
Review once more and click **Finish Configuration**  to create the cluster profile. 
<br />

## Deploy a Cluster
From the **Profile** page,  click on the newly created cluster profile to view its details page. Palette displays all the layers and allows you to edit any of them. 
<br />

![Screenshot of the Profile Layers success.](/tutorials/edge-native/clusters_edge_palette-canvos_profile-success.png)

Click on the **Deploy** button and refer to the [Create an Edge Native Host Cluster](/clusters/edge/site-deployment/site-installation/cluster-deployment) guide to deploy a new Edge cluster. The cluster deployment wizard will display the following sections. 

### Basic Information
Use the following values in the first section, **Basic Information**. 

|**Field**|**Value**|
|---|---|
|Cluster name| docs-tutorial-cluster |
|Description| Cluster as part of the Edge tutorial.|
|Tags|`spectro-cloud-education, app:hello-universe, terraform_managed:false`|

Click **Next** to continue.
<br /> 

### Parameters
The **Parameters** section allows you to change the profile configurations. For example, clicking on the **BYOS Edge OS 1.0.0** layer allows you to configure the `system.registry`, `system.repo`, and other available parameters. 

Keep the default values for all layers and click **Next**.
<br />

### Cluster config
Provide the Virtual IP (VIP) address for the host cluster to be used by the physical site during the cluster configuration process. You can optionally select an SSH key to remote into the host cluster and provide a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server list, if available, with you.  

Click **Next** to continue.    
<br />

### Nodes config
In the **Nodes config** section, provide details for the master pool. 

|**Field** | **Value for the master-pool**| 
|---| --- | 
|Node pool name| master-pool | 
|Allow worker capability| Checked | 
|Additional Labels (Optional) | None |
|[Taints](/clusters/cluster-management/taints/)|Off|
|Pool Configuration > Edge Hosts | Choose one or more registered Edge hosts. |

Similarly, provide details for the worker pool. 

|**Field** | **Value for the worker-pool**| 
|---| --- | 
|Node pool name| worker-pool | 
|Additional Labels (Optional) | None |
|Taints|Off|
|Pool Configuration > Edge Hosts | Choose one or more registered Edge hosts. |

Click **Next** to continue.    
<br /> 

### Settings 
The **Settings** section displays options for OS patching, scheduled scans, scheduled backups, and cluster role binding. Use the default values, and click on the **Validate** button.      
<br /> 

### Review
Review all configurations in this section. The **Review** page displays the cluster name, tags, VIP, node pools, and layers. If everything looks good, click on the **Finish Configuration** button to finish deploying the cluster. Deployment may take up to *20 minutes* to finish. 

While deployment is in progress, Palette displays the cluster status as **Provisioning**. While you wait for the cluster to finish deploying, you can explore the various tabs on the cluster details page, such as **Overview**, **Workloads**, and **Events**. 
<br /> 


# Validate
In Palette, navigate to the left **Main Menu** and select **Clusters**. Next, select your cluster to display the cluster Overview page and monitor cluster provisioning progress.  

![Screenshot of the cluster health.]()


When cluster status displays **Running** and **Healthy**, you can access the application from the exposed service URL with the port number displayed. For the Hello Universe application, one of the random port random port between 30000-32767 is exposed. Click on the port number to access the application.
<br />

<WarningBox>

We recommend waiting to click on the service URL, as it takes one to three minutes for DNS to properly resolve the public NodePort URL. This prevents the browser from caching an unresolved DNS request.

</WarningBox>

You can also look at real-time metrics, such as CPU and memory consumption, in the cluster's **Overview** tab in Palette. 

You have successfully provisioned an Edge cluster and deployed the Hello Universe application on it. 

<br />

# Cleanup
Delete the cluster, cluster profile, and the Edge hosts. 

The following steps will guide you in cleaning up your environment. Follow the steps for Palette if you used Palette to deploy the cluster. Use Terraform commands to delete the cluster if you used Terraform for deployment. 
<br />

<br />

##  Delete the Cluster and Profile using Palette
Navigate to the **Cluster** section in Palette's left **Main Menu**, and view the details page of the cluster. To delete the cluster, click on the **Settings** button to expand the **drop-down Menu**, and select the **Delete Cluster** option. Palette prompts you to enter the cluster name and confirm the delete action. Type the cluster name to proceed with the delete step. 

The cluster status will turn to **Deleting**. Deletion takes up to 10 minutes.
<br />


After you delete the cluster, go ahead and delete the profile. From the left **Main Menu**, click **Profiles** and select the profile to delete. Choose the **Delete** option in the **three-dot Menu**. Wait for the resources to clean up and ensure they are successfully deleted. 
<br />

</Tabs.TabPane>

<Tabs.TabPane tab="Terraform Code" key="terraform_ui_delete">

<br />

##  Delete the Cluster and Profile using Terraform
If you've used Terraform to deploy the cluster, switch back to the tutorials container, and issue the following command from within the **/terraform/pack-tf** directory:
<br />

```bash
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

Wait for the resources to clean up. Deleting the Terraform resources may take up to 10 minutes. 
<br />

```bash
# Output condensed for readability
Destroy complete! Resources: 2 destroyed.
```

To remove the container and the image from the local machine, issue the following commands:
<br />

```bash
docker container rm --force tutorialContainer
docker image rm --force ghcr.io/spectrocloud/tutorials:1.0.3
```
