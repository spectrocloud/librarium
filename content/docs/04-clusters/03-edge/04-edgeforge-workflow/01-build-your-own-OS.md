# Overview

Edge supports using a different Operating System (OS)  for your Edge host runtime. Building a system using your OS requires creating a Kairos-based image from your raw OS image.

The instructions in this guide are optional if all you want to do is build an Edge artifact from one of Palette's out-of-the-box supported OS.

As an example, the following steps will guide you through the procedure to build a Kairos-based RHEL image. You can alter the steps as needed for your operating system. 

# Next Steps


Your next step is to evaluate if you need to create a content bundle. To create a content bundle, check out the [Build Content Bundle](/clusters/edge/edgeforge-workflow/build-content-bundle) guide.
