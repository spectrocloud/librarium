# Overview
Palette's Edge solution requires Edge hosts to be ready with the required tools and configurations before deploying a Kubernetes cluster. An Edge host requires the following artifacts for a successful deployment:
<br />

* **Edge installer ISO image** - This bootable ISO image helps install the necessary tools and configurations on a bare host machine. During installation, the host machine will boot from the Edge installer ISO, partition the disk, copy the image to the disk, install the software (Palette Edge host agent and metadata), and perform several configuration steps. These configuration steps include registering the host with Palette, setting user privileges, and configuring network or security settings. 
<br />

* **Provider OS image** - This is a [Kairos](https://kairos.io/)-based image. This image helps install an immutable Operating System (OS) and software dependencies compatible with a specific Kubernetes version at runtime, i.e., during the cluster deployment.  


In this guide, you will use Spectro Cloud's utility, CanvOS, to create an Edge installer ISO image and two provider OS images - one compatible with lightweight Kubernetes (K3s) v1.24.6 and another compatible with K3s v1.25.2.


This guide presents two workflows - Basic and Advanced. You can follow either of the workflows below. Use Basic for a quick start to get all the required artifacts for preparing an Edge host. Use the Advanced section for detailed instructions and to learn about customization options you can apply to this workflow.

# Prerequisites
To complete this guide, you will need the following items:
<br/>

* A physical or virtual Linux machine with **AMD64** (also known as **x86_64**) processor architecture. You can issue the following command in the terminal to check your processor architecture. 
  <br/>

  ```bash
  uname -m
  ```

* Minimum hardware configuration:
  - 4 CPU
  - 8 GB memory
  - 50 GB storage
 

* [Git](https://cli.github.com/manual/installation) version 2.30.x or later. You can check your git version using `git --version` command.


* [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) version 20.10.x or later. Using the ' docker version ' command, you can check the Docker Engine version. Ensure you can create [privileged containers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#privileged) on your machine.


* A [Spectro Cloud](https://console.spectrocloud.com) account. If you have not signed up, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://www.spectrocloud.com/free-tier/).


* Palette registration token for pairing Edge hosts with Palette. You will need tenant admin access to Palette to generate a new registration token. For detailed instructions, refer to the [Create Registration Token](/clusters/edge/site-deployment/site-installation/create-registration-token) guide.


# Build Edge Artifacts
Here are the instructions for a quick start to create all the required artifacts. 
<br />

1. Check out the [CanvOS](https://github.com/spectrocloud/CanvOS.git) GitHub repository containing the starter code. 
  <br />

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/spectrocloud/CanvOS.git
  ```


2. Change to the **CanvOS/** directory. 
  <br />

  ```bash
  cd CanvOS
  ```


3. The files relevant to the current guide are in the **v3.3.3** tag. Check out the desired tag. You can check out a more recent and stable version if available. 
  <br />

  ```shell
  git checkout v3.3.3
  ```


4. Review the relevant files. 
  <br />

  ```bash
  .
  ├── .arg          # Defines mutiple variables
  ├── Dockerfile    # Bakes the arguments to use in the image
  ├── Earthfile     # Series of commands for creating target images
  ├── earthly.sh    # Script to invoke the Earthfile, and generate target images
  └── user-data.template  # A sample user-data file
  ```
  <br />


5. Define a custom image tag for provider OS images. To change the image tag, edit the value for the `CUSTOM_TAG` variable in the **.arg** file. Ensure that it is of lowercase alphanumeric characters. 
  <br />

  ```bash
  CUSTOM_TAG=palette-learn
  ```
  <br />


6. Create a **user-data** file that embeds the Edge host's login credentials and registration token in the Edge installer ISO image. Issue the command below to save your registration token in a local variable. 
<br />

  ```bash
  token="your_token_here"
  ```
  <br />
  
7. Next, copy and issue the command below to create the **user-data** file. Also, you can click on the *Points of Interest* numbers below to learn more about the main attributes relevant to this example. 
  <br />

  <PointsOfInterest

  install:
    poweroff: true
  users:
    - name: kairos
      passwd: kairos
  EOF
  ```

  </PointsOfInterest>
  <br />


7. Issue the following command to execute the **earthly.sh** file to build the Edge artifacts. The `--PE_VERSION` option in the command below signifies the Palette Edge version to use. The current example uses the **v3.3.3** git tag.
  <br />

  ```shell
  ./earthly.sh +build-all-images --PE_VERSION=$(git describe --abbrev=0 --tags)
  ```

  ```bash coloredLines=2-2
  # Output condensed for readability
  ===================== Earthly Build SUCCESS ===================== 
  Share your logs with an Earthly account (experimental)! Register for one at https://ci.earthly.dev.
  ```
  This command may take up to 15-20 minutes to finish depending on the resources of the host machine.
  <br />


8. List the Docker images to show two provider OS images - one compatible with K3s v1.24.6 and another with K3s v1.25.2.
<br />

  ```shell
  docker images
  ```

  ```bash coloredLines=3-4
  # Output
  REPOSITORY        TAG                                IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
  ttl.sh/ubuntu     k3s-1.25.2-v3.3.3-palette-learn    b3c4956ccc0a   6 minutes ago   2.49GB
  ttl.sh/ubuntu     k3s-1.24.6-v3.3.3-palette-learn    fe1486da25df   6 minutes ago   2.49GB
  earthly/earthly   v0.7.4                             d771cc8edc38   2 weeks ago     333MB
  ```


9. To use the provider OS images in your cluster profile, push them to the image registry mentioned in the **.arg** file. The current example and default behavior uses the [ttl.sh](https://ttl.sh/) image registry. This image registry is free to use and does not require a sign-up. Images pushed to *ttl.sh* are ephemeral and will expire after the 24 hrs time limit.  Use the following commands to push the provider OS image to the *ttl.sh* image registry.  
  <br />

  ```bash
  docker push ttl.sh/ubuntu:k3s-1.25.2-v3.3.3-palette-learn
  docker push ttl.sh/ubuntu:k3s-1.24.6-v3.3.3-palette-learn
  ```
  <br />

  <WarningBox>

  As a reminder, [ttl.sh](https://ttl.sh/) is a short-lived image registry. If you do not use these provider OS images in your cluster profile within 24 hours of pushing to *ttl.sh*, they will expire and must be re-pushed. Refer to the Advanced workflow in the current guide to learn how to use another registry, such as Docker Hub, and tag the docker images accordingly.

  </WarningBox>
  <br />


# Validate
List the Edge installer ISO image and checksum by issuing the following command from the **CanvOS/** directory.
<br />

```shell
ls build/
```

```shell
# Output
palette-edge-installer.iso      
palette-edge-installer.iso.sha256
```

You can validate the ISO image by creating a bootable USB flash drive using any third-party software and attempting to flash a bare host machine. Most software that creates a bootable USB drive will validate the ISO image. Here, the flash process means installing the necessary tools and configurations on a  host machine.


# Next Steps
Your next step is to use the Edge installer ISO image to prepare hosts and use the provider OS image to prepare a cluster profile and deploy a Kubernetes cluster on those hosts.

For detailed instructions, refer to the [Create Registration Token](/clusters/edge/site-deployment/site-installation/create-registration-token) guide.


* An account with [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) image registry. If you do not have an account with Docker Hub already, refer to the [Create an account](https://docs.docker.com/docker-id/) page for signing-up instructions. 
<br />

  <InfoBox>

  This guide uses Docker Hub as an example. You can, however, use any other desired image registry to suit your requirements.

  </InfoBox>
  <br />

* A public repository named `opensuse-leap` in your image registry. Refer to the [Create a repository](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/create/#create-a-repository) instructions for creating a Docker Hub repository and setting the repository's visibility to public. 


# Build Edge Artifacts
Here are the detailed instructions for creating customized artifacts.
<br />

1. Check out the [CanvOS](https://github.com/spectrocloud/CanvOS.git) GitHub repository containing the starter code. 
  <br />

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/spectrocloud/CanvOS.git
  ```
  

2. Change to the **CanvOS/** directory. 
  <br />

  ```bash
  cd CanvOS
  ```


3. The files relevant to the current guide are in the **v3.3.3** tag. Check out the desired tag. You can check out a more recent and stable version if available.
  <br />

  ```shell
  git checkout v3.3.3
  ```


4. Review the relevant files.  
  <br />

  ```bash
  .
  ├── .arg          # Defines mutiple variables
  ├── Dockerfile    # Bakes the arguments to use in the image
  ├── Earthfile     # Series of commands for creating target images
  ├── earthly.sh    # Script to invoke the Earthfile, and generate target images
  └── user-data.template  # A sample user-data file
  ```
  <br />


5. Review the **.arg** file containing the customizable arguments, such as image tag, image registry, image repository, and OS distribution. The table below shows all arguments, their default, and possible values.

  |**Argument**|**Description**|**Default Value**| **Allowed Values** |
  |---|---|---|---|
  |`CUSTOM_TAG`|Tag for the provider images|demo|Lowercase alphanumeric string without spaces.|
  |`IMAGE_REGISTRY`|Image registry name|ttl.sh|Your image registry hostname, without `http` or `https` <br /> Example: docker.io/spectrocloud|
  |`OS_DISTRIBUTION`|OS Distribution |ubuntu | ubuntu, opensuse-leap|
  |`IMAGE_REPO`|Image repository name.<br /> It is the same as the OS distribution.|`$OS_DISTRIBUTION`|Your image repository name.|
  |`OS_VERSION`|OS version, only applies to Ubuntu |22| 20, 22|
  |`K8S_DISTRIBUTION`|Kubernetes Distribution |k3s| k3s, rke2, kubeadm |
  |`ISO_NAME`|Name of the Installer ISO|palette-edge-installer|Lowercase alphanumeric string without spaces. It can include `-` and `_`. |
<br />


6. Open the **.arg** file in an editor to customize the image tag, image registry, and OS distribution. Update the `CUSTOM_TAG` value to a string made up of lowercase alphanumeric characters. This example uses `palette-learn` value. 
<br />

  ```bash
  CUSTOM_TAG=palette-learn
  ```


7. In the **.arg** file, update the `IMAGE_REGISTRY` value to point it to the Docker Hub host. If you use any other image registry, the hostname must comply with standard DNS rules but may not contain underscores. Replace `[DOCKER-ID]` in the declaration below with your Docker ID. 
<br />

  ```bash
  IMAGE_REGISTRY=docker.io/[DOCKER-ID]    # Follows [HOST]/[DOCKER-ID] syntax. Example: docker.io/spectrocloud
  ```


8. In the **.arg** file, update the `OS_DISTRIBUTION` value to use OpenSuse Leap. 
<br />

  ```bash
  OS_DISTRIBUTION=opensuse-leap
  ``` 

  Use default values for the remaining variables. 
  <br />

  <WarningBox>

  Using the arguments defined in the **.arg** file, the final provider image name will have this syntax - `[IMAGE_REGISTRY]/[OS_DISTRIBUTION]:[CUSTOM_TAG]`. Ensure that this final artifact name conforms to the Docker Hub image name syntax - `[HOST]/[DOCKER-ID]/[REPOSITORY]:[TAG]` to push your images to Docker Hub later in this guide. 

  </WarningBox>
  <br />


9. Open the Dockerfile in an editor, and add instructions to install [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/install/) on the Edge host. Add your customizations below the line tagged with the `Add any other image customizations here` comment. Do not edit or add any lines before this tagged comment. A sample Dockerfile is available below. You can install more tools and dependencies and configure the host to suit your needs.
  <br />

  ```bash
  ARG BASE
  FROM $BASE
  
  # ############ Add any other image customizations here ############
  # Install WireGuard on OpenSuse machine
  RUN sudo zypper refresh
  RUN sudo zypper install -y wireguard-tools
  ```
  <br />  
  <WarningBox>

  Using the `-y` option with the `sudo zypper install` command is essential to execute it non-interactively and let the package manager assume "yes" as an answer to all prompts. Otherwise, the image build process will fail. 

  </WarningBox>
  <br />


10. Create a **user-data** file that embeds the Edge host's login credentials and registration token in the Edge installer ISO image. Issue the command below to save your registration token in a local variable. 
<br />

  ```bash
  token="your_token_here"
  ```
  
  Copy and issue the command below to create the **user-data** file. Also, you can click on the *Points of Interest* numbers below to learn more about the main attributes relevant to this example.

    - name: kairos
      passwd: kairos
  EOF
  ```

  </PointsOfInterest> 

  If you want further customization, refer to the [Edge Configuration Stages](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/clusters/edge/edge-configuration/cloud-init#edgeconfigurationstages) and [User Data Parameters](https://docs-latest.spectrocloud.com/clusters/edge/edge-configuration/installer-reference) documents outlining different other stages and possible parameters, respectively. 
  <br />


11. Issue the following command to execute the **earthly.sh** file to build the Edge artifacts. The `--PE_VERSION` option in the command below signifies the Palette Edge version to use. Spectro Cloud generates a git tag for each new Palette release. The current example uses the **v3.3.3** git tag.
  <br />

  ```shell
  ./earthly.sh +build-all-images --PE_VERSION=$(git describe --abbrev=0 --tags)
  ```

  ```bash coloredLines=2-2
  # Output condensed for readability
  ===================== Earthly Build SUCCESS ===================== 
  Share your logs with an Earthly account (experimental)! Register for one at https://ci.earthly.dev.
  ```
  This command will take up to 15-20 minutes to finish.
  <br />


12. List the Docker images to show two provider OS images - one compatible with K3s v1.24.6 and another with K3s v1.25.2.
<br />

  ```shell
  docker images
  ```

  ```bash coloredLines=3-4
  # Output
  REPOSITORY                   TAG                               IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
  spectrocloud/opensuse-leap   k3s-1.25.2-v3.3.3-palette-learn   2427e3667b2f   24 minutes ago   2.22GB
  spectrocloud/opensuse-leap   k3s-1.24.6-v3.3.3-palette-learn   0f2efd533a33   24 minutes ago   2.22GB
  earthly/earthly              v0.7.4                            d771cc8edc38   6 weeks ago      333MB
  ```


13. To use the provider OS images in your cluster profile, push them to your image registry. Issue the following command to login to Docker Hub. Provide your Docker ID and password when it prompts.
<br />

  ```bash
  docker login
  ```

  ```bash
  # Output
  WARNING! Your password will be stored unencrypted in /home/ubuntu/.docker/config.json.
  Configure a credential helper to remove this warning. See
  https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credentials-store

  Login Succeeded
  ```
  <br />


14. Use the following commands to push the the provider OS image to the Docker Hub image registry.  
<br />

  ```bash
  docker push docker.io/spectrocloud/opensuse-leap:k3s-1.25.2-v3.3.3-palette-learn
  docker push docker.io/spectrocloud/opensuse-leap:k3s-1.24.6-v3.3.3-palette-learn
  ```
  <br />


# Validate
List the Edge installer ISO image and checksum by issuing the following command from the **CanvOS/** directory.
<br />

```shell
ls build/
```

```shell
# Output
palette-edge-installer.iso      
palette-edge-installer.iso.sha256
```

You can validate the ISO image by creating a bootable USB flash drive using any third-party software and attempting to flash a bare host machine. Most software that creates a bootable USB drive will also validate the ISO image. Here, the flash process means installing the necessary tools and configurations on a  host machine.


# Next Steps
Your next step is to use the Edge installer ISO image to prepare hosts and use the provider OS image to prepare a cluster profile and deploy a Kubernetes cluster on those hosts.
