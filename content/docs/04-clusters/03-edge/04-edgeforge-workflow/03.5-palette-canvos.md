# Build Edge Artifacts
Palette's Edge solution requires Edge hosts to be ready with the required dependencies and [user data](/clusters/edge/edge-configuration/installer-reference) configurations before deploying a Kubernetes cluster. An Edge host requires the following artifacts to prepare for successful cluster deployment:

<br />

* **Edge installer ISO image** - This bootable ISO image installs the necessary dependencies and configurations on a bare host machine. During installation, the host machine will boot from the Edge installer ISO, partition the disk, copy the image content to the disk, install the Palette Edge host agent and metadata, and perform several configuration steps. These configuration steps include registering the host with Palette, setting user privileges, and configuring network or security settings. 
<br />

* **Provider Images** - These are [Kairos](https://kairos.io/)-based images containing the OS and the desired Kubernetes versions. These images install an immutable Operating System (OS) and software dependencies compatible with a specific Kubernetes version at runtime, i.e., during the cluster deployment. A provider image is used in the OS and the Kubernetes layer when creating a cluster profile. 


In this guide, you will use the utility, [CanvOS](https://github.com/spectrocloud/CanvOS/blob/main/README.md), to build an Edge installer ISO image and provider images for all the Palette-supported Kubernetes versions. The utility builds multiple provider images, so you can use either one that matches the desired Kubernetes version you want to use with your cluster profile.


The diagram below shows the high-level steps to building the Edge artifacts and pushing the provider images to an image registry.



![Overarching diagram showing the workflow in the current guide.](/tutorials/palette-canvos/clusters_edge_palette-canvos_artifacts.png)


This guide presents two workflows - Basic and Advanced. 

The basic workflow has minimal customizations and offers a quick start to build Edge artifacts. This workflow builds an Ubuntu based Edge installer ISO and provider images. You will also push the provider images to the default image registry, [ttl.sh](https://ttl.sh/). 

The advanced workflow uses more customization options. This workflow builds an openSUSE based Edge installer ISO and provider images. You will push the provider images to your Docker Hub image registry. 

You can follow either of the workflows below that suits your use case.

<br />

## Prerequisites

To complete this basic guide, you will need the following items:
<br/>

* A physical or virtual Linux machine with *AMD64* (also known as *x86_64*) processor architecture to build the Edge artifacts. You can issue the following command in the terminal to check your processor architecture. 
  <br/>

  ```bash
  uname -m
  ```

* Minimum hardware configuration of the Linux machine:
  - 4 CPU
  - 8 GB memory
  - 50 GB storage
 

* [Git](https://cli.github.com/manual/installation). You can ensure git installation by issuing the `git --version` command.


* [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) version 18.09.x or later. You can use the `docker --version` command to view the existing Docker version. You should have root-level or `sudo` privileges on your Linux machine to create privileged containers.   


* A [Spectro Cloud](https://console.spectrocloud.com) account. If you have not signed up, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://www.spectrocloud.com/free-tier/).


* Palette registration token for pairing Edge hosts with Palette. You will need tenant admin access to Palette to generate a new registration token. For detailed instructions, refer to the [Create Registration Token](/clusters/edge/site-deployment/site-installation/create-registration-token) guide.



## Instructions

Use the following instructions on your Linux machine to create all the required Edge artifacts with minimal customization. 
<br />

1. Check out the [CanvOS](https://github.com/spectrocloud/CanvOS) GitHub repository containing the starter code. 

  <br />

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/spectrocloud/CanvOS.git
  ```





2. Change to the **CanvOS/** directory. 
  <br />

  ```bash
  cd CanvOS
  ```


3. View the available [git tag](https://github.com/spectrocloud/CanvOS/tags).
<br />

  ```bash
  git tag
  ```


4. Check out the newest available tag. This guide uses **v3.4.3** tag as an example. 
  <br />

  ```shell
  git checkout v3.4.3
  ```


5. Review the files relevant for this guide. 
    - **.arg.template** - A sample **.arg** file that defines arguments to use during the build process. 
    - **Dockerfile** - Embeds the arguments and other configurations in the image.
    - **Earthfile** - Contains a series of commands to create target artifacts.
    - **earthly.sh** - Script to invoke the Earthfile, and generate target artifacts.
    - **user-data.template** - A sample user-data file.
  <br />


6. Issue the command below to assign an image tag value that will be used when creating the provider images. This guide uses the value `palette-learn` as an example. However, you can assign any lowercase and alphanumeric string to the `CUSTOM_TAG` variable. 
<br />

  ```bash
  export CUSTOM_TAG=palette-learn
  ```
  <br />

7. Issue the command below to create the **.arg** file with the custom tag. It uses the default values for the remaining variables. You can refer to the existing **.arg.template** file to learn more about the available customizable variables.  
<br /> 

  ```bash
  cat << EOF > .arg
  CUSTOM_TAG=$CUSTOM_TAG
  IMAGE_REGISTRY=ttl.sh
  OS_DISTRIBUTION=ubuntu
  IMAGE_REPO=ubuntu
  OS_VERSION=22
  K8S_DISTRIBUTION=k3s
  ISO_NAME=palette-edge-installer
  PE_VERSION=$(git describe --abbrev=0 --tags)
  platform=linux/amd64
  EOF
  ```
  
  View the newly created file to ensure the customized variables are set correctly.
  <br />

  ```bash
  cat .arg
  ```
  <br />

8. Issue the command below to save your tenant registration token to an environment variable. Replace `[your_token_here]` with your actual registration token. 
<br />

  ```bash
  export token=[your_token_here]
  ```
  <br />
  
9. Use the following command to create the **user-data** file containing the tenant registration token. Also, you can click on the *Points of Interest* numbers below to learn more about the main attributes relevant to this example. 
  <br />

  <PointsOfInterest
    points={[
      {
        x: 260,
        y: 187,
        label: 1,
        description: "Stores the registration token and lets the agent use the auto-registration functionality and authenticate with the provided token.",
        tooltipPlacement: "rightTop",
      },
      {
        x: 190,
        y: 262,

        y: 340,
        label: 3,
        description: "Sets the login credentials for Edge hosts. The login credentials will allow you to SSH log into the edge host for debugging purposes.",
        tooltipPlacement: "rightTop",
      },
    ]}
  >

  ```shell
  cat << EOF > user-data
  #cloud-config
  stylus:
    site:
      edgeHostToken: $token
  install:
    poweroff: true
  users:
    - name: kairos
      passwd: kairos
  EOF
  ```

  </PointsOfInterest>
  <br />

  View the newly created user data file to ensure the token is set correctly.
<br />

  ```bash
  cat user-data
  ``` 
  <br />

10. The CanvOS utility uses [Earthly](https://earthly.dev/) to build the target artifacts. Issue the following command to start the build process.
<br />

  ```bash
  sudo ./earthly.sh +build-all-images
  ```

  ```bash coloredLines=2-2 hideClipboard
  # Output condensed for readability
  ===================== Earthly Build SUCCESS ===================== 
  Share your logs with an Earthly account (experimental)! Register for one at https://ci.earthly.dev.
  ```
  This command may take up to 15-20 minutes to finish depending on the resources of the host machine.
  <br />


11. List the Docker images to review the provider images created. By default, provider images for all the Palette's Edge-supported Kubernetes versions are created. You can identify the provider images by reviewing the image tag value you used in the  **.arg** file's `CUSTOM_TAG` variable. 
<br />

  ```shell
  docker images --filter=reference='*/*:*palette-learn'
  ```

  ```bash coloredLines=3-4 hideClipboard
  # Output
  REPOSITORY        TAG                                IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
  ttl.sh/ubuntu     k3s-1.25.2-v3.4.3-palette-learn    b3c4956ccc0a   6 minutes ago   2.49GB
  ttl.sh/ubuntu     k3s-1.24.6-v3.4.3-palette-learn    fe1486da25df   6 minutes ago   2.49GB
  ```
  <br />


12. To use the provider images in your cluster profile, push them to the image registry mentioned in the **.arg** file. The current example and default behavior uses the [ttl.sh](https://ttl.sh/) image registry. This image registry is free to use and does not require a sign-up. Images pushed to *ttl.sh* are ephemeral and will expire after the 24 hrs time limit.  Use the following commands to push the provider images to the *ttl.sh* image registry.  
  <br />

  ```bash
  docker push ttl.sh/ubuntu:k3s-1.25.2-v3.4.3-palette-learn
  docker push ttl.sh/ubuntu:k3s-1.24.6-v3.4.3-palette-learn
  ```
  <br />

  <WarningBox>

  As a reminder, [ttl.sh](https://ttl.sh/) is a short-lived image registry. If you do not use these provider images in your cluster profile within 24 hours of pushing to *ttl.sh*, they will expire and must be re-pushed. Refer to the Advanced workflow in the current guide to learn how to use another registry, such as Docker Hub, and tag the docker images accordingly.

  </WarningBox>
  <br />


13. After pushing the provider images to the image registry, open your web browser and navigate to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com) to create a cluster profile, and add the [BYOS Edge OS](/integrations/byoos) pack to the OS layer. Add the following custom content within your OS layer configuration's `options` attribute so that the cluster profile can pull the provider image from the image registry. 

  The following `system.xxxxx` attribute values should be as same as what you defined in the **.arg** file earlier. If you used customized arguments in the **.arg** file to build the Edge artifacts, change these attributes' values, as applicable to you, before using them in your cluster profile.

  <br />

  ```yaml
    system.uri: "{{ .spectro.pack.edge-native-byoi.options.system.registry }}/{{ .spectro.pack.edge-native-byoi.options.system.repo }}:{{ .spectro.pack.edge-native-byoi.options.system.k8sDistribution }}-{{ .spectro.system.kubernetes.version }}-{{ .spectro.pack.edge-native-byoi.options.system.peVersion }}-{{ .spectro.pack.edge-native-byoi.options.system.customTag }}"
    system.registry: ttl.sh
    system.repo: ubuntu
    system.k8sDistribution: k3s
    system.osName: ubuntu
    system.peVersion: v3.4.3
    system.customTag: palette-learn
    system.osVersion: 22
  ```
  The screenshot below shows you how to reference a provider image in a cluster profile by using the utility build output with the BYOOS pack.

  ![Screenshot of a sample cluster profile's OS layer ](/tutorials/palette-canvos/clusters_edge_palette-canvos_edit_profile.png)
  <br />

  <InfoBox>

  The BYOOS pack's `system.uri` variable references the Kubernetes version selected in the cluster profile through the usage of the `{{ .spectro.system.kubernetes.version }}` [macro](/clusters/cluster-management/macros). This is how the provider images you created and pushed to a registry are tied to the OS and Kubernetes choices you selected or referenced in the **.arg** file.

  </InfoBox>

14. Add the Kubernetes layer to your cluster profile after updating the OS layer, and choose the **Palette Optimized K3s** pack. The current build process created provider images compatible with two Kubernetes versions - K3s v1.24.6 and K3s v1.25.2. Therefore, choose one of these versions for the **Palette Optimized K3s** pack. 


15. Lastly, add the network layer to your cluster profile, and choose a Container Network Interface (CNI) pack that best fits your needs, such as Calico, Flannel, Cilium, or Custom CNI. 

  This step completes the core infrastructure layers in the cluster profile. Next, you can add add-on layers to your cluster profile. 
  <br />


## Validate
List the Edge installer ISO image and checksum by issuing the following command from the **CanvOS/** directory.
<br />

```shell
ls build/
```

```shell hideClipboard
# Output
palette-edge-installer.iso      
palette-edge-installer.iso.sha256
```

You can validate the ISO image by creating a bootable USB flash drive using any third-party software and attempting to flash a bare host machine. Most software that creates a bootable USB drive will validate the ISO image. Here, the flash process means installing the necessary tools and configurations on a  host machine.

  | `PE_VERSION`       | The Palette Edge installer version.  This should match the tag checked out from Git.  This is an advanced setting.  Do not modify unless told to do so.           | String | Git tags.               | 
| `platform`         | Type of platform to use for the build.  Used for cross platform builds (arm64 to amd64 as example).                                       | string |  `linux/amd64`          | 

  Next, you will customize these variables to use during the build process. 
<br />

7. Issue the command below to assign an image tag value that will be used when creating the provider images. This guide uses the value `palette-learn` as an example. However, you can assign any lowercase and alphanumeric string to the `CUSTOM_TAG` variable. 
<br />

  ```bash
  export CUSTOM_TAG=palette-learn
  ```
  <br />

8. Use the command below to save the Docker Hub image registry hostname in the `IMAGE_REGISTRY` variable. Before you execute the command, replace `[DOCKER-ID]` in the declaration below with your Docker ID. Your image registry hostname must comply with standard DNS rules and may not contain underscores. 
<br />

  ```bash
  export IMAGE_REGISTRY=docker.io/[DOCKER-ID]    # Follows [HOST]/[DOCKER-ID] syntax. Example: docker.io/spectrocloud
  ```
  <br />

9. Issue the following command to use the openSUSE Leap OS distribution. 
<br />

  ```bash
  export OS_DISTRIBUTION=opensuse-leap
  ``` 
  <br />

10. Issue the command below to create the **.arg** file with the custom tag, Docker Hub image registry hostname, and openSUSE Leap OS distribution. It uses the default values for the remaining variables. You can refer to the existing **.arg.template** file to learn more about the available customizable variables.   
<br />

  ```bash
  cat << EOF > .arg
  IMAGE_REGISTRY=$IMAGE_REGISTRY
  OS_DISTRIBUTION=$OS_DISTRIBUTION
  IMAGE_REPO=$OS_DISTRIBUTION
  CUSTOM_TAG=$CUSTOM_TAG
  K8S_DISTRIBUTION=k3s
  ISO_NAME=palette-edge-installer
  PE_VERSION=$(git describe --abbrev=0 --tags)
  platform=linux/amd64
  EOF
  ```
  
  View the newly created file to ensure the customized variables are set correctly.
  <br />

  ```bash
  cat .arg
  ```
  <br />

  <WarningBox>

  Using the arguments defined in the **.arg** file, the final provider image name will have the following naming pattern, `[IMAGE_REGISTRY]/[IMAGE_REPO]:[CUSTOM_TAG]`. Ensure the final artifact name conforms to the Docker Hub image name syntax - `[HOST]/[DOCKER-ID]/[REPOSITORY]:[TAG]`. 

  </WarningBox>
  <br />

11. Use the following command to append the [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/install/) installation instructions to the Dockerfile. You can install more tools and dependencies and configure the image to meet your needs. Add your customizations below the line tagged with the `Add any other image customizations here` comment in the Dockerfile. Do not edit or add any lines before this tagged comment. 
  <br />

  ```bash
  echo 'RUN sudo zypper refresh && sudo zypper install -y wireguard-tools' >> Dockerfile
  ```

  View the newly created file to ensure the instruction to install WireGuard is appended correctly.
  <br />

  ```bash
  cat Dockerfile
  ```
  <br />  
  <WarningBox>

  Using the `-y` option with the `sudo zypper install` command is critical to successfully build the images. The default behavior for package installations is to prompt the user for permission to install the package. A user prompt will cause the image creation process to fail. This guidance applies to all dependencies you add through the **Dockerfile**. 

  </WarningBox>
  <br />

12. Issue the command below to save your tenant registration token to a local variable. Replace `[your_token_here]` with your actual registration token. 
<br />

  ```bash
  export token=[your_token_here]
  ```
  <br />
  
13. Use the following command to create the **user-data** file containing the tenant registration token. Also, you can click on the *Points of Interest* numbers below to learn more about the main attributes relevant to this example.

  ```

  </PointsOfInterest> 

  View the newly created user data file to ensure the token is set correctly.
<br />

  ```bash
  cat user-data
  ```
  
  If you want further customization, check the existing **user-data.template** file, and refer to the [Edge Configuration Stages](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/clusters/edge/edge-configuration/cloud-init#edgeconfigurationstages) and [User Data Parameters](https://docs-latest.spectrocloud.com/clusters/edge/edge-configuration/installer-reference) documents to learn more. 
  <br />

14. CanvOS utility uses [Earthly](https://earthly.dev/) to build the target artifacts. Issue the following command to start the build process. 
<br />

  ```bash
  sudo ./earthly.sh +build-all-images
  ```

  ```bash coloredLines=2-2 hideClipboard
  # Output condensed for readability
  ===================== Earthly Build SUCCESS ===================== 
  Share your logs with an Earthly account (experimental)! Register for one at https://ci.earthly.dev.
  ```

  This command may take up to 15-20 minutes to finish depending on the resources of the host machine.
  <br />

15. List the Docker images to review the provider images created. By default, provider images for all the Palette's Edge-supported Kubernetes versions are created. You can identify the provider images by reviewing the image tag value you used in the  **.arg** file's `CUSTOM_TAG` variable. 
<br />

  ```shell
  docker images --filter=reference='*/*:*palette-learn'
  ```

  ```bash coloredLines=3-4 hideClipboard
  # Output
  REPOSITORY                   TAG                               IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
  spectrocloud/opensuse-leap   k3s-1.25.2-v3.4.3-palette-learn   2427e3667b2f   24 minutes ago   2.22GB
  spectrocloud/opensuse-leap   k3s-1.24.6-v3.4.3-palette-learn   0f2efd533a33   24 minutes ago   2.22GB
  ```
  <br />

16. To use the provider images in your cluster profile, push them to your image registry mentioned in the **.arg** file. Issue the following command to log in to Docker Hub. Provide your Docker ID and password when prompted.
<br />

  ```bash
  docker login
  ```

  ```bash hideClipboard
  # Output
  Login Succeeded
  ```
  <br />

17. Use the following commands to push the provider images to the Docker Hub image registry you specified. Replace the `[DOCKER-ID]` and version numbers in the command below with your Docker ID and respective Kubernetes versions that the utility created. 
<br />

  ```bash
  docker push docker.io/[DOCKER-ID]/opensuse-leap:k3s-1.25.2-v3.4.3-palette-learn
  docker push docker.io/[DOCKER-ID]/opensuse-leap:k3s-1.24.6-v3.4.3-palette-learn
  ```
  <br />

18. After pushing the provider images to the image registry, open your web browser and navigate to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com) to create a cluster profile, and add the [BYOS Edge OS](/integrations/byoos) pack to the OS layer. Add the following custom content within your OS layer configuration's `options` attribute so that the cluster profile can pull the provider image from the image registry. 

  The following `system.xxxxx` attribute values should be as same as what you defined in the **.arg** file earlier. If you used customized arguments in the **.arg** file to build the Edge artifacts, change these attributes' values, as applicable to you, before using them in your cluster profile.

    system.uri: "{{ .spectro.pack.edge-native-byoi.options.system.registry }}/{{ .spectro.pack.edge-native-byoi.options.system.repo }}:{{ .spectro.pack.edge-native-byoi.options.system.k8sDistribution }}-{{ .spectro.system.kubernetes.version }}-{{ .spectro.pack.edge-native-byoi.options.system.peVersion }}-{{ .spectro.pack.edge-native-byoi.options.system.customTag }}"

  The screenshot below shows you how to reference your provider OS image in a cluster profile by using the utility build output with the BYOOS pack.

  <br />

  <InfoBox>

  The BYOOS pack's `system.uri` variable references the Kubernetes version selected in the cluster profile through the usage of the `{{ .spectro.system.kubernetes.version }}` [macro](/clusters/cluster-management/macros). This is how the provider images you created and pushed to a registry are tied to the OS and Kubernetes choices you selected or referenced in the **.arg** file.

19. Add the Kubernetes layer to your cluster profile after updating the OS layer, and choose the **Palette Optimized K3s** pack. The current build process created provider images compatible with two Kubernetes versions - K3s v1.24.6 and K3s v1.25.2. Therefore, choose one of these versions for the **Palette Optimized K3s** pack. 


20. Lastly, add the network layer to your cluster profile, and choose a Container Network Interface (CNI) pack that best fits your needs, such as Calico, Flannel, Cilium, or Custom CNI. 

   This step completes the core infrastructure layers in the cluster profile. You can insert add-on layers to your cluster profile should you want to add additional software or resources to your cluster.

## Validate
List the Edge installer ISO image and checksum by issuing the following command from the **CanvOS/** directory.
<br />

```shell
ls build/
```

```shell hideClipboard
# Output
palette-edge-installer.iso      
palette-edge-installer.iso.sha256
```

You can validate the ISO image by creating a bootable USB flash drive using any third-party software and attempting to flash a bare host machine. Most software that creates a bootable USB drive will validate the ISO image. Here, the flash process means installing the necessary tools and configurations on a  host machine.

# Next Steps

After building the Edge artifacts and creating an Edge cluster profile, the next step is to use the Edge Installer ISO image to prepare your Edge host. Check out the [Prepare Edge Host for Installation](/clusters/edge/site-deployment/stage) guide to learn more about the next steps.
