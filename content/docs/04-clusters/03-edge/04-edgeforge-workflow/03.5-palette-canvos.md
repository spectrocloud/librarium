# Overview
Palette's Edge solution requires Edge hosts to be ready with the required dependencies and [user data](/clusters/edge/edge-configuration/installer-reference) configurations before deploying a Kubernetes cluster. An Edge host requires the following artifacts for a successful deployment:

<br />

* **Edge installer ISO image** - This bootable ISO image installs the necessary dependencies and configurations on a bare host machine. During installation, the host machine will boot from the Edge installer ISO, partition the disk, copy the image content to the disk, install the Palette Edge host agent and metadata, and perform several configuration steps. These configuration steps include registering the host with Palette, setting user privileges, and configuring network or security settings. 
<br />

* **Provider OS image** - This is a [Kairos](https://kairos.io/)-based image. This image installs an immutable Operating System (OS) and software dependencies compatible with a specific Kubernetes version at runtime, i.e., during the cluster deployment.  


In this guide, you will use Spectro Cloud's utility, [CanvOS](https://github.com/spectrocloud/CanvOS), to create an Edge installer ISO image and two provider OS images - one compatible with lightweight Kubernetes (K3s) v1.24.6 and another compatible with K3s v1.25.2.


This guide presents two workflows - Basic and Advanced. You can follow either of the workflows below. Use Basic for a quick start to get all the required artifacts for preparing an Edge host. Use the Advanced section for detailed instructions and to learn about customization options you can apply to this workflow.

# Prerequisites
To complete this guide, you will need the following items:
<br/>

* A physical or virtual Linux machine with **AMD64** (also known as **x86_64**) processor architecture. You can issue the following command in the terminal to check your processor architecture. 
  <br/>

  ```bash
  uname -m
  ```

* Minimum hardware configuration:
  - 4 CPU
  - 8 GB memory
  - 50 GB storage
 

* [Git](https://cli.github.com/manual/installation) version 2.30.x or later. You can check your git version using `git --version` command.


* [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) version 20.10.x or later. You can use the `docker version` command to check the Docker Engine version. Ensure you can create [privileged containers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#privileged) on your machine.


* A [Spectro Cloud](https://console.spectrocloud.com) account. If you have not signed up, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://www.spectrocloud.com/free-tier/).


* Palette registration token for pairing Edge hosts with Palette. You will need tenant admin access to Palette to generate a new registration token. For detailed instructions, refer to the [Create Registration Token](/clusters/edge/site-deployment/site-installation/create-registration-token) guide.


# Build Edge Artifacts

Use the following instructions for a quick start to create all the required Edge artifacts. 
<br />

1. Check out the [CanvOS](https://github.com/spectrocloud/CanvOS.git) GitHub repository containing the starter code. 
  <br />

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/spectrocloud/CanvOS.git
  ```


2. Change to the **CanvOS/** directory. 
  <br />

  ```bash
  cd CanvOS
  ```


3. The files relevant to the current guide are in the **v3.4.3** tag. Check out the desired tag. You can check out a more recent and stable version if available. 
  <br />

  ```shell
  git checkout v3.4.3
  ```


4. Review the relevant files. 
  <br />

  ```bash
  .
  ├── .arg          # Defines mutiple variables
  ├── Dockerfile    # Bakes the arguments to use in the image
  ├── Earthfile     # Series of commands for creating target images
  ├── earthly.sh    # Script to invoke the Earthfile, and generate target images
  └── user-data.template  # A sample user-data file
  ```
  <br />


5. Define a custom image tag for the provider OS images. To change the image tag, edit the value for the `CUSTOM_TAG` variable in the **.arg** file. Use lowercase and alphanumeric characters. 
  <br />

  ```bash
  CUSTOM_TAG=palette-learn
  ```
  <br />


6. Create a **user-data** file that includes the tenant registration token. Issue the command below to save your registration token to a local variable. 
<br />

  ```bash
  token="your_token_here"
  ```
  <br />
  
7. Next, copy and issue the command below to create the **user-data** file. Also, you can click on the *Points of Interest* numbers below to learn more about the main attributes relevant to this example. 
  <br />

  <PointsOfInterest

  install:
    poweroff: true
  users:
    - name: kairos
      passwd: kairos
  EOF
  ```

  </PointsOfInterest>
  <br />


7. Issue the following command to start the **earthly.sh** script to build the Edge artifacts. The `--PE_VERSION` option in the command below signifies the Palette Edge version to use. The current example uses the **v3.4.3** git tag.
  <br />

  ```shell
  ./earthly.sh +build-all-images --PE_VERSION=$(git describe --abbrev=0 --tags)
  ```

  ```bash coloredLines=2-2
  # Output condensed for readability
  ===================== Earthly Build SUCCESS ===================== 
  Share your logs with an Earthly account (experimental)! Register for one at https://ci.earthly.dev.
  ```
  This command may take up to 15-20 minutes to finish depending on the resources of the host machine.
  <br />


8. List the Docker images to verify the two provider OS images - one compatible with K3s v1.24.6 and another with K3s v1.25.2.
<br />

  ```shell
  docker images
  ```

  ```bash coloredLines=3-4
  # Output
  REPOSITORY        TAG                                IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
  ttl.sh/ubuntu     k3s-1.25.2-v3.4.3-palette-learn    b3c4956ccc0a   6 minutes ago   2.49GB
  ttl.sh/ubuntu     k3s-1.24.6-v3.4.3-palette-learn    fe1486da25df   6 minutes ago   2.49GB
  earthly/earthly   v0.7.4                             d771cc8edc38   2 weeks ago     333MB
  ```


9. To use the provider OS images in your cluster profile, push them to the image registry mentioned in the **.arg** file. The current example and default behavior uses the [ttl.sh](https://ttl.sh/) image registry. This image registry is free to use and does not require a sign-up. Images pushed to *ttl.sh* are ephemeral and will expire after the 24 hrs time limit.  Use the following commands to push the provider OS image to the *ttl.sh* image registry.  
  <br />

  ```bash
  docker push ttl.sh/ubuntu:k3s-1.25.2-v3.4.3-palette-learn
  docker push ttl.sh/ubuntu:k3s-1.24.6-v3.4.3-palette-learn
  ```
  <br />

  <WarningBox>

  As a reminder, [ttl.sh](https://ttl.sh/) is a short-lived image registry. If you do not use these provider OS images in your cluster profile within 24 hours of pushing to *ttl.sh*, they will expire and must be re-pushed. Refer to the Advanced workflow in the current guide to learn how to use another registry, such as Docker Hub, and tag the docker images accordingly.

  </WarningBox>
  <br />


# Validate
List the Edge installer ISO image and checksum by issuing the following command from the **CanvOS/** directory.
<br />

```shell
ls build/
```

```shell
# Output
palette-edge-installer.iso      
palette-edge-installer.iso.sha256
```

You can validate the ISO image by creating a bootable USB flash drive using any third-party software and attempting to flash a bare host machine. Most software that creates a bootable USB drive will validate the ISO image. Here, the flash process means installing the necessary tools and configurations on a  host machine.

For detailed instructions, refer to the [Create Registration Token](/clusters/edge/site-deployment/site-installation/create-registration-token) guide.


* An account with [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) image registry. If you do not have an account with Docker Hub already, refer to the [Create an account](https://docs.docker.com/docker-id/) page for signing-up instructions. 
<br />

  <InfoBox>

  This guide uses Docker Hub as an example. You can use other image registries that suit your requirements.

  </InfoBox>
  <br />

* A public repository named `opensuse-leap` in your image registry. Refer to the [Create a repository](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/create/#create-a-repository) instructions for creating a Docker Hub repository and setting the repository's visibility to `public`. 


# Build Edge Artifacts

Use the following instructions to create all the required Edge artifacts. 
<br />

1. Check out the [CanvOS](https://github.com/spectrocloud/CanvOS.git) GitHub repository containing the starter code. 
  <br />

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/spectrocloud/CanvOS.git
  ```
  

2. Change to the **CanvOS/** directory. 
  <br />

  ```bash
  cd CanvOS
  ```


3. The files relevant to the current guide are in the **v3.4.3** tag. Check out the desired tag. You can check out a more recent and stable version if available.
  <br />

  ```shell
  git checkout v3.4.3
  ```


4. Review the relevant files.  
  <br />

  ```bash
  .
  ├── .arg          # Defines mutiple variables
  ├── Dockerfile    # Bakes the arguments to use in the image
  ├── Earthfile     # Series of commands for creating target images
  ├── earthly.sh    # Script to invoke the Earthfile, and generate target images
  └── user-data.template  # A sample user-data file
  ```
  <br />


5. Review the **.arg** file containing the customizable arguments, such as image tag, image registry, image repository, and OS distribution. The table below shows all arguments, their default value, and allowed values.

  |**Argument**|**Description**|**Default Value**| **Allowed Values** |
  |---|---|---|---|
  |`CUSTOM_TAG`|Tag for the provider images|demo|Lowercase alphanumeric string without spaces.|
  |`IMAGE_REGISTRY`|Image registry name|ttl.sh|Your image registry hostname, without `http` or `https` <br /> Example: docker.io/spectrocloud|
  |`OS_DISTRIBUTION`|OS Distribution |ubuntu | ubuntu, opensuse-leap|
  |`IMAGE_REPO`|Image repository name.<br /> It is the same as the OS distribution.|`$OS_DISTRIBUTION`|Your image repository name.|
  |`OS_VERSION`|OS version, only applies to Ubuntu |22| 20, 22|
  |`K8S_DISTRIBUTION`|Kubernetes Distribution |k3s| k3s, rke2, kubeadm |
  |`ISO_NAME`|Name of the Installer ISO|palette-edge-installer|Lowercase alphanumeric string without spaces. The charaters `-` and `_` are allowed. |
<br />


6. Open the **.arg** file in a text editor to customize the image tag, image registry, and OS distribution. Update the `CUSTOM_TAG` value to a string made up of lowercase alphanumeric characters. This example uses `palette-learn` value. 
<br />

  ```bash
  CUSTOM_TAG=palette-learn
  ```


7. In the **.arg** file, update the `IMAGE_REGISTRY` value to point to your Docker Hub host or another image registry. If you use other image registries, the hostname must comply with standard DNS rules and may not contain underscores. Replace `[DOCKER-ID]` in the declaration below with your Docker ID. 
<br />

  ```bash
  IMAGE_REGISTRY=docker.io/[DOCKER-ID]    # Follows [HOST]/[DOCKER-ID] syntax. Example: docker.io/spectrocloud
  ```


8. In the **.arg** file, update the `OS_DISTRIBUTION` value to use OpenSuse Leap. Use the default values for the remaining variables. 
<br />

  ```bash
  OS_DISTRIBUTION=opensuse-leap
  ``` 

  <br />

  <WarningBox>

  Using the arguments defined in the **.arg** file, the final provider image name will have the following naming pattern, `[IMAGE_REGISTRY]/[OS_DISTRIBUTION]:[CUSTOM_TAG]`. Ensure the final artifact name conforms to the Docker Hub image name syntax - `[HOST]/[DOCKER-ID]/[REPOSITORY]:[TAG]`. 

  </WarningBox>
  <br />


9. Open the **Dockerfile** in a text editor, and add instructions to install [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/install/) on the Edge host. Add your customizations below the line tagged with the `Add any other image customizations here` comment. Do not edit or add any lines before this tagged comment. You can install more tools and dependencies and configure the image to meet your needs.
  <br />

  ```bash
  ARG BASE
  FROM $BASE
  
  # ############ Add any other image customizations here ############
  # Install WireGuard on OpenSuse machine
  RUN sudo zypper refresh && sudo zypper install -y wireguard-tools
  ```
  <br />  
  <WarningBox>

  Using the `-y` option with the `sudo zypper install` command is critical to successfully build the images. The default behavior for package installations is to prompt the user for permission to install the package. A user prompt will cause the image ceration process to fail. This guidance applies to all dependencies you add through the **Dockerfile**. 

  </WarningBox>
  <br />


10. Create a **user-data** file that includes the tenant registration token. Issue the command below to save your registration token to a local variable. 
<br />

  ```bash
  token="your_token_here"
  ```
  
  Copy and issue the command below to create the **user-data** file. Also, you can click on the *Points of Interest* numbers below to learn more about the main attributes relevant to this example.

  If you want further customization, refer to the [Edge Configuration Stages](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/clusters/edge/edge-configuration/cloud-init#edgeconfigurationstages) and [User Data Parameters](https://docs-latest.spectrocloud.com/clusters/edge/edge-configuration/installer-reference) documents to learn more. 
  <br />


11. Issue the following command to start the **earthly.sh** script that create the Edge artifacts. The `--PE_VERSION` option in the command below signifies the Palette Edge version to use. Spectro Cloud generates a git tag for each new Palette release. The current example uses the **v3.4.3** git tag.
  <br />

  ```shell
  ./earthly.sh +build-all-images --PE_VERSION=$(git describe --abbrev=0 --tags)
  ```

  ```bash coloredLines=2-2
  # Output condensed for readability
  ===================== Earthly Build SUCCESS ===================== 
  Share your logs with an Earthly account (experimental)! Register for one at https://ci.earthly.dev.
  ```

  This command may take up to 15-20 minutes to finish depending on the resources of the host machine.

  <br />


12. List the Docker images to verify the two provider OS images - one compatible with K3s v1.24.6 and another with K3s v1.25.2.

<br />

  ```shell
  docker images
  ```

  ```bash coloredLines=3-4
  # Output
  REPOSITORY                   TAG                               IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
  spectrocloud/opensuse-leap   k3s-1.25.2-v3.4.3-palette-learn   2427e3667b2f   24 minutes ago   2.22GB

  earthly/earthly              v0.7.4                            d771cc8edc38   6 weeks ago      333MB
  ```


13. To use the provider OS images in your cluster profile, push them to your image registry. Issue the following command to log in to Docker Hub. Provide your Docker ID and password when prompted.
<br />

  ```bash
  docker login
  ```

  Output
  ```bash
  # Output
  WARNING! Your password will be stored unencrypted in /home/ubuntu/.docker/config.json.
  Configure a credential helper to remove this warning. See
  https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credentials-store

  Login Succeeded
  ```
  <br />


14. Use the following commands to push the provider OS images to the Docker Hub image registry you specified. Replace the registry in the command below with your registry name and path. 
<br />

  ```bash
  docker push docker.io/spectrocloud/opensuse-leap:k3s-1.25.2-v3.4.3-palette-learn
  docker push docker.io/spectrocloud/opensuse-leap:k3s-1.24.6-v3.4.3-palette-learn
  ```
  <br />


# Validate

List the Edge installer ISO image and checksum by issuing the following command from the **CanvOS/** directory.
<br />

```shell
ls build/
```

Output
```shell
palette-edge-installer.iso      
palette-edge-installer.iso.sha256
```

You can validate the ISO image by creating a bootable USB flash drive using any third-party software and attempting to flash a bare host machine. Most software that creates a bootable USB drive will also validate the ISO image. Here, the flash process means installing the necessary tools and configurations on a  host machine.
