# Overview

In Kubernetes, namespaces provide a way to isolate groups of resources within a single cluster. Some of the benefits of namespaces are:

- They can be used to partition resources among multiple users via resource quota – where each namespace has its own set of resources – without having to set up multiple physical clusters.


- You can configure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) based on namespaces. For information about configuring namespaces and RBAC, check out [RBAC and NS Support](/clusters/cluster-management/cluster-rbac).


- Namespaces can be used for different purposes such as testing, development, and production.


- You can use namespaces to help prevent resource naming conflicts. Resource names must be unique within a namespace but not across namespaces.


- In environments that have hybrid containerized and virtualized applications, a separate namespace can be used to isolate virtual machines (VMs). For information about a virtual machine environment in Palette, check out [Virtual Machine Management](/vm-management).



# Create a Namespace

The following steps will guide you to create a namespace.



## Prerequisites

- A running cluster.


- Permission to create a namespace.


- A unique namespace name.



## Create a Namespace in a Cluster

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com) as a tenant admin.


2. Navigate to the left **Main Menu** and click on **Clusters**.


3. Select the cluster in which you want to create a namespace. 


4. Navigate to the **Workloads** > **Namespaces** tab, and click the **Manage Namespaces** button.

    <br />

    The **Settings** pane displays with **RBAC** > **Namespaces** preselected.

5. Type a unique namespace name in the **Namespace name or Regex** field and click **Add to List** at right. 

    <br />

    The namespace name is listed under **Workspace Quota**.


6. You can assign resource quotas now or at a later time. To learn how, check out [Assign Resource Quotas](/clusters/cluster-management/namespace-management#assignresourcequotas).

    <br />

    For details on how to configure RBAC for namespaces, check out the [RBAC and NS Support](/clusters/cluster-management/cluster-rbac) guide.



## Validation

Validate that the namespace was successfully created. 

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com) as a tenant admin.


2. Navigate to the left **Main Menu** and click on **Clusters**.


3. Select the cluster that contains the namespace you created and view its details.


4. In the **Settings** pane, click **RBAC** > **Namespaces** tab.

    <br />

    The namespace you created will be listed under **Workspace Quota**.



# Assign Resource Quotas

You can assign resource quotas for resource sharing among multiple users who have access to a namespace.



## Prerequisites

- A running cluster with at least one namespace.



## Assign Resource Quotas to a Namespace

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com) as a tenant admin.


2. Navigate to the left **Main Menu** and click on **Clusters**.


3. Select the cluster with the namespace to which you will assign workspace quotas.


4. Navigate to the **Workloads** > **Namespaces** tab, and click the **Manage Namespaces** button.


5. The **Settings** pane displays with **RBAC** > **Namespaces** preselected.


6. Select the namespace listed in the **Workspace Quota** section.

<br />

7. Type the number of CPU and Memory to allocate.



# Delete a Namespace

When you delete a namespace, all the resources that were created within the namespace will also be deleted, such as pods, services and endpoints, config maps, and more. 



## Prerequisites

- Ensure that no other resources depend on the namespace being deleted.

## Delete a Namespace from a Cluster

1. Navigate to the left **Main Menu** and click on **Clusters**.


2. Select the cluster in which you want to create a namespace. 


3. Navigate to the **Workloads** > **Namespaces** tab, and click the **Manage Namespaces** button.

    <br />

    The **Settings** pane displays with **RBAC** > **Namespaces** preselected.


4. Select the namespace you want to delete, which is listed in the **Workspace Quota** section, and click the trash can icon. 


## Validation

Validate that the namespace was successfully deleted. 


1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com) as a tenant admin.


2. Navigate to the left **Main Menu** and click on **Clusters**.


3. Select the cluster that contains the namespace you want to delete and view its details.


4. In the **Settings** pane, click **RBAC** > **Namespaces** tab.

    <br />

    The namespace you created is no longer be listed under **Workspace Quota**.
