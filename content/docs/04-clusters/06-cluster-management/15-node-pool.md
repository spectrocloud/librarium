# Overview

You have the ability to update node pools for active clusters and the option to create a new node pool for the cluster.

<br />

<WarningBox>

Ensure you exercise caution when modifying node pools. We recommend creating a [backup](/clusters/cluster-management/backup-restore) before you make a change in the event a configuration change causes an issue.

# Create a New Node Pool

You can create a new node pool for an active cluster. To create a new node pool follow the steps below.

1. Ensure you are in the correct scope or project.


2. Navigate to the left **Main Menu** and click on **Clusters**.


3. Click on the row of the cluster you want to edit the node pool.


4. Click on the **Nodes** tab.


5. Click on **New Node Pool**. 


6. Fill out the input fields in the **Add node pool** page. The following table contains an explanation of the available input parameters.


### Master Node Pool

| Property | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Node pool name** | A descriptive name for the node pool. |
| **Number of nodes in the pool** | Number of nodes to be provisioned for the node pool. For the master pool, this number can be 1, 3, or 5. |
| **Allow worker capability** | Select this option to allow workloads to be provisioned on master nodes. |
| **Additional Labels** | Optional labels apply placement constraints on a pod. For example, you can add a label to make a node eligible to receive the workload. To learn more, refer to the [Overview on Labels](/clusters/cluster-management/taints#overviewonlabels). |
| **Taints** | Sets toleration to pods and allows (but does not require) the pods to schedule onto nodes with matching taints. To learn more, refer to the [Overview on Taints](/clusters/cluster-management/taints#overviewontaints).|
| **Availability Zones** | The Availability Zones from which to select available servers for deployment. If you select multiple zones, Palette will deploy servers evenly across them as long as sufficient servers are available to do so. |
| **Disk Size** | Give the required storage size. |


### Worker Node Pool

| Property | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Node pool name** | A descriptive name for the worker pool. |
| **Number of nodes in the pool** | Number of nodes to be provisioned for the node pool. |
| **Additional Labels** | Optional labels apply placement constraints on a pod. For example, you can add a label to make a node eligible to receive the workload. To learn more, refer to the [Overview on Labels](/clusters/cluster-management/taints#overviewonlabels). |
| **Taints** | Sets toleration to pods and allows (but does not require) the pods to schedule onto nodes with matching taints. To learn more, refer to the [Overview on Taints](/clusters/cluster-management/taints#overviewontaints).|
| **Rolling update** |  Apply the update policy. **Expand first** launches new nodes and then terminates old notes. **Contract first** terminates old nodes and then launches new ones. |
| **Instance Option** | AWS options for compute capacity. **On Demand** gives you full control over the instance lifecycle without long-term commitment. **Spot** allows the use of spare EC2 capacity at a discount but which can be reclaimed if needed. |
| **Instance Type** |The compute size. |
| **Availability Zones** | The Availability Zones from which to select available servers for deployment. If you select multiple zones, Palette will deploy servers evenly across them as long as sufficient servers are available to do so. |
| **Disk Size** | Give the required storage size. |
 
**Note**: Currently Palette does not support Autoscaler for Azure clusters.

7. Click on **Confirm** to create the new node pool.


# Change a Node Pool

Palette allows its users to apply changes to a node pool, including its taints label for a running cluster. To make changes to the an active cluster's node pools, follow the steps below. 

1. Ensure you are in the correct scope or project.


2. Navigate to the left **Main Menu** and click on **Clusters**.


3. Click on the row of the cluster you want to edit the node pool.


4. Click on the **Nodes** tab.


5. The nodes details page is where you can review the existing node pools and their configuration. You can also add a new node pool from this page. Click on the **Edit** button to make changes to the node pool.


6. Make changes as needed.


7. Click on **Confirm** to update the node pool.
