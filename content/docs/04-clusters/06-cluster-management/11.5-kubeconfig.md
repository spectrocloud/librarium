# Overview

A [kubeconfig](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/) file is a configuration file used to access a Kubernetes cluster. It contains information such as the cluster's API server address, authentication credentials, and cluster-specific settings. The kubeconfig file allows you to authenticate and interact with the cluster using the kubectl CLI or other Kubernetes client tools.


The kubeconfig file plays a crucial role in enabling you and other users to issue kubectl commands against the host cluster. It ensures that you have the necessary permissions and access to the cluster's resources. By using the kubeconfig file, you can validate your access to the host cluster and perform various operations, such as deploying applications, managing resources, and monitoring the cluster.

Overall, the kubeconfig file serves as a key component in connecting and interacting with a Kubernetes cluster, providing you with the necessary configuration and credentials to access the cluster's API server.


You can download the kubeconfig file from the cluster details page in Palette. You can then set the KUBECONFIG environment variable to the file path of the kubeconfig file in your terminal window.

```bash hideClipboard
export KUBECONFIG=~/Downloads/dev-cluster.kubeconfig 
```

Refer to the [Access Cluster with CLI](/clusters/cluster-management/palette-webctl) guide for steps on how to connect to your host cluster with the kubectl CLI.
