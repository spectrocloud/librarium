# Palette Virtual Clusters Overview

Palette Virtual Clusters are Kubernetes clusters that run as nested clusters within an existing cluster (also known as a Host Cluster) and share the host cluster resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage. By default, Palette Virtual Clusters will use [k3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s) as virtual Kubernetes cluster, which is a highly available, certified Kubernetes distribution designed for production workloads.


Palette provisions and orchestrates Palette Virtual Clusters and makes it easy to use the lightweight, Kubernetes technology stack and tools ecosystem. Deploy Palette Virtual Clusters on both new and imported Host Clusters as simple as following the wizard and attaching Add-on profiles.

Palette also supports Day 2 operations such as upgrades, backup/restore and more, to keep Palette Virtual Clusters secure, compliant, and up to date. Additionally, it provides visibility into the workloads running inside your Palette Virtual Clusters and its associated costs.

To get started, refer to [Add Virtual Clusters to a Host Cluster](/clusters/add-virtual-cluster-to-host-cluster).

## Accessibility Options

Two Palette Virtual Cluster accessibility options are supported:<p></p><br />
1. **Load Balancer** <br />
The Host Cluster must support dynamic provisioning of load balancers, either via a Cloud Controller Manager in the public cloud or a bare metal load balancer provider, such as MetalLB.<p></p><br />

1. **Ingress** <br />
The NGINX Ingress Controller must be deployed on the Host cluster with SSL passthrough enabled. This allows TLS termination to occur at the Palette Virtual Cluster's Kubernetes API server.<br />

   A wildcard DNS record must be configured that maps to the load balancer associated with the NGINX Ingress Controller.

   For example:

   `*.myapp.mydomain.com`

<br />
