# Overview

Palette supports placeholder variables as Macros in our cluster profile layers. These macros make regression and update of variables, across multiple-running clusters, easier. We encourage creating these macros and using them within any of our cluster profile layers. Hence, changes to the existing Macros get updated to the corresponding cluster profile and the clusters with these profiles attached. 

# Scope of Palette Macros

Palette users can declare the Macros under three different scopes:

1. **Project Scope**: Create `Macros` from the project dashboard with project privileges.


2. **Tenant Admin Scope**: Create macros from the `Tenant Admin Dashboard` with administrative privileges.


3. **System Scope**: Includes the default system macros and user-created system macros.

The Macros must have unique names within a given application, but Macros with a different Scope can have a unique name. In such cases, the precedence followed is in decreasing order (the highest precedence being Project Scope).


  **Project Scope** > **Tenant Scope** > **System Scope**


# Create your Macro

Palette users can use Macros in three different Scopes. Following the user preferences and privileges, log in as a Tenant Admin or Project Admin, to create macros under Tenant Admin scope and Project Scope, respectively. System Scope Macros can be created via API's. The steps to create a macro are as below:

## Example

```yaml
manifests:
  aws_ebs:
    #Storage type should be one of io1, gp2, sc1, st1 types          #Checkhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html for more details
    storageType: "gp2"
    #Allowed reclaim policies are Delete, Retain
    reclaimPolicy: "Delete"
    #Toggle for Volume expansion
    allowVolumeExpansion: "true"
    #Toggle for Default class
    isDefaultClass: "true"
    #Supported binding modes are Immediate, WaitForFirstConsumer
    #Setting this to WaitForFirstConsumer for AWS, so that the volumes gets created in the same AZ as that of the pods
    volumeBindingMode: "{{.spectro.macro.volumeBindingMode}}"
```
# Use your Macros

The Macros are overridden into the Cluster Profile layers:
* During a Cluster Profile creation.


* For a Cluster Profile used by a running cluster or during cluster provisioning.

 `{{.spectro.macro.macro-name}}`, where the *macro-name* is the **Custom name**, created by the user.


4. Save the changes to the **Cluster Profile**. This Macro can be replaced or edited later.
