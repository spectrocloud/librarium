# Deploy a Cluster

Palette helps you create and manage Kubernetes clusters in various cloud environments with minimal overhead.

Palette offers profile-based management for Kubernetes, enabling consistency, repeatability, and operational efficiency across multiple clusters. A [cluster profile](/cluster-profiles) allows you to customize the cluster infrastructure stack, allowing you to choose the desired Operating System (OS), Kubernetes, Container Network Interfaces (CNI), Container Storage Interfaces (CSI). You can further customize the stack with add-on application layers. 

After defining a cluster profile, you can provide the cloud environment details, the control plane, and worker node configurations to deploy a host cluster.

This tutorial will teach you how to deploy a host cluster with Palette using Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) cloud providers. You can deploy a cluster using either Palette or Terraform. You will learn about *Cluster Mode* and *Cluster Profiles* and how these components enable you to deploy customized applications to Kubernetes with minimal effort.

# Architecture 

As you navigate the tutorial, refer to this diagram to help you understand how Palette uses a cluster profile as a blueprint for the host cluster you deploy. Palette clusters have the same node pools you may be familiar with: control plane nodes, often called *master nodes*, and *worker nodes* where you will deploy applications. The result is a host cluster that Palette manages.

You can create and manage clusters directly from the Palette dashboard. Use the following steps to learn how to deploy a host cluster to multiple cloud providers.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you will need the following.

- A public cloud account from one of these providers:
  - [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account)
  - [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-an-azure-account)
  - [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/docs/get-started)

  <br />

- Register the cloud account in Palette. The following resources provide additional guidance.
  - [Register and Manage AWS Accounts](/clusters/public-cloud/aws/add-aws-accounts)
  - [Register and Manage Azure Cloud Accounts](/clusters/public-cloud/azure/azure-cloud)
  - [Register and Manage GCP Accounts](/clusters/public-cloud/gcp#creatingagcpcloudaccount)

  <br />

- An SSH Key Pair. Use the [Create and Upload an SSH Key](/clusters/cluster-management/ssh-keys) guide to learn how to create an SSH key and upload it to Palette.

  - AWS users must create an AWS Key pair before starting the tutorial. If you need additional guidance, check out the [Create EC2 SSH Key Pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ground-station/latest/ug/create-ec2-ssh-key-pair.html) tutorial.

## Deploy the Environment

The following steps will guide you through deploying the cluster infrastructure. You will start by creating a cluster profile that you apply to the host cluster.

<br />

<Tabs>
<Tabs.TabPane tab="AWS" key="aws-ui">

### Create Cluster Profile (AWS)

[Cluster profiles](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/cluster-profiles) are templates you create with the following core layers and any add-on layers such as security, monitoring, logging, and more.

 - Operating System (OS)
 - Kubernetes distribution and version
 - Network Container Interface (CNI)
 - Storage Container Interface (CSI)
 

You customize profiles by choosing the type of component and version. In this way, profiles offer a reproducible way to create clusters.

Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com) and navigate to the left **Main Menu**. Select **Profiles** to view the cluster profile page.
You can view the list of available cluster profiles. To create a cluster profile, click the **Add Cluster Profile** button.

![View of the cluster Profiles page](/tutorials/deploy-clusters/clusters_public-cloud_deploy-k8s-cluster_profile_list_view.png)

Follow the wizard to create a new profile.

In the **Basic Information** section, assign the name **aws-profile**, a brief profile description, select the type as **Full**, and assign the tag **env:aws**. You can leave the version empty if you want to. Just be aware that the version defaults to **1.0.0**. Click on **Next**.

**Cloud Type** allows you to choose the infrastructure provider with which this cluster profile is associated. Select **AWS** and click on **Next**.

**Profile Layers**, this is the main configuration step where you specify the packs that compose the profile. There are four required infrastructure packs and several optional add-on packs you can choose from.
Every pack requires you to select the **Pack Type**, **Registry**, and **Pack Name**.

For this tutorial, use the following packs:

| Pack Name          | Version   | Layer              |
|--------------------|-----------|--------------------|
| ubuntu-aws LTS     | 20.4.x    | Operating System   |
| Kubernetes         | 1.24.x  | Kubernetes         |
| cni-calico         | 3.24.x    | Network            |
| csi-aws-ebs        | 1.16.x | Storage            |


As you fill out the information for each layer, click on **Next** to proceed to the next layer.

Click on **Confirm** after you have completed filling out all the core layers.

![A view of the cluster profile stack](/tutorials/deploy-clusters/aws/clusters_public-cloud_deploy-k8s-cluster_clusters_parameters.png)

## Update Cluster Profile

In the following steps, you will learn how to update a cluster profile by adding a new layer to it that contains the application.

<br />

### Add a Manifest

Navigate to the left **Main Menu** and select **Profiles**. Select the cluster profile you created earlier and which you applied to the host cluster.

Click on **Add Manifest** at the top of the page and fill out the following input fields. <br /> <br />

- **Layer name** - The name of the layer. Assign the name **application**.


- **Manifests**  - Add your manifest by giving it a name and clicking the **New Manifest** button. Assign a name to the internal manifest and click on the blue button  An empty editor will be displayed on the right side of the screen.

![Screenshot of unopened manifest editor](/tutorials/deploy-clusters/clusters_public-cloud_deploy-k8s-cluster_manifest_blue_btn.png)

<br />

In the manifest editor, insert the following content.

<br />

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello-universe-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 8080
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: hello-universe
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello-universe-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello-universe
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello-universe
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello-universe
        image: ghcr.io/spectrocloud/hello-universe:1.0.11
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

The code snippet you added will deploy the [*hello-universe*](https://github.com/spectrocloud/hello-universe) application. You may have noticed that the code snippet you added is a Kubernetes configuration. Manifest files are a method you can use to achieve more granular customization of your Kubernetes cluster. You can add any valid Kubernetes configuration to a manifest file.

![Screenshot of manifest in the editor](/tutorials/deploy-clusters/clusters_public-cloud_deploy-k8s-cluster_manifest.png)

The manifest defines a replica set for the application to simulate a distributed environment with a web application deployed to Kubernetes. The application is assigned a load balancer. Using a load balancer, you can expose a single access point and distribute the workload to both containers.

Click on **Confirm & Create** to save your changes.

<br />


### Deployment

Navigate to the left **Main Menu** and select **Clusters**. Click on the host cluster you deployed to open its details page.


On the top right-hand corner is a blue button **Updates Available**. Click on the button to review the available updates. 

![The cluster details page with a view of pending updates](/tutorials/deploy-clusters/clusters_public-cloud_deploy-k8s-cluster_update_available.png)


Compare the new changes against the previous cluster profile definition. The only difference is the addition of a manifest that will deploy the Hello Universe application.


![Available updates details](/tutorials/deploy-clusters/deploy_app/clusters_public-cloud_deploy-k8s-cluster_update_details_compare.png)

Click on **Confirm updates** to apply the updates to the host cluster. Depending on the scope of the change this may take a few moments.

<br />


## Verify the Application

Navigate to the cluster's details page and verify you are in the **Overview** tab. When the application is deployed and ready for network traffic, indicated in the **Services** field, Palette exposes the service URL. Click on the URL for port **:8080** to access the Hello Universe application.

To remove the cluster, navigate to the left **Main Menu** and click on **Clusters**. Select the cluster you want to delete to access its details page.

Click on **Settings** to expand the menu, and select **Delete Cluster**.

![Delete cluster](/tutorials/deploy-clusters/clusters_public-cloud_deploy-k8s-cluster_delete-cluster-button.png)

You will be prompted to type in the cluster name to confirm the delete action. Type in the cluster name to proceed with the delete step. The deletion process takes several minutes to complete.

<br />

<InfoBox>

If a cluster remains in the delete phase for over 15 minutes, it becomes eligible for a force delete. To trigger a force delete, navigate to the cluster’s details page, click on **Settings**, then select **Force Delete Cluster**. Palette automatically removes clusters stuck in the cluster deletion phase for over 24 hours.

</InfoBox>


<br />

Once the cluster is deleted, navigate to the left **Main Menu** and click on **Profiles**. Find the cluster profile you created and click on the **three-dot Menu** to display the **Delete** button. Select **Delete** and confirm the selection to remove the cluster profile.

##  Terraform

The [Spectro Cloud Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs) provider enables you to create and manage Palette resources in a codified manner by leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Some notable reasons why you would want to utilize IaC are: 

- The ability to automate infrastructure.

- Improved collaboration in making infrastructure changes.

- Self-documentation of infrastructure through code.

- Allows tracking all infrastructure in a single source of truth. 

If want to become more familiar with Terraform, we recommend you check out the [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro) learning resources from HashiCorp.

## Create an API Key

Before you can get started with the Terraform code, you need a Spectro Cloud API key. 

To create an API key, log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com) and click on the user **User Menu** and select **My API Keys**. 

![Image that points to the user drop-down Menu and points to the API key link](/tutorials/deploy-clusters/clusters_public-cloud_deploy-k8s-cluster_create_api_key.png)

Next, click on **Add New API Key**. Fill out the required input field, **API Key Name**, and the **Expiration Date**. Click on **Confirm** to create the API key. Copy the key value to your clipboard, as you will use it shortly.

<br />

In your terminal session, issue the following command to export the API key as an environment variable.

<br />

```shell
export SPECTROCLOUD_APIKEY=YourAPIKeyHere
```

The [Spectro Cloud Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs) provider requires credentials to interact with the Palette API.
The Spectro Cloud Terraform provider will use the environment variable to authenticate with the Spectro Cloud API endpoint. 


## Resources Review

To help you get started with Terraform, the tutorial code is structured to support deploying a cluster to either Azure, GCP, or AWS. Before you deploy a host cluster to your target provider, take a few moments to review the following files in the folder structure.

<br />

- **providers.tf** - This file contains the Terraform providers that are used to support the deployment of the cluster.


- **inputs.tf** - This file contains all the Terraform variables for the deployment logic.


- **data.tf** - This file contains all the query resources that perform read actions.


- **cluster_profiles.tf** - This file contains the cluster profile definitions for each cloud provider.


- **cluster.tf** - This file has all the required cluster configurations to deploy a host cluster to one of the cloud providers.


- **terraform.tfvars** - Use this file to customize the deployment and target a specific cloud provider. This is the primary file you will modify.


- **outputs.tf** - This file contains content that will be output in the terminal session upon a successful Terraform `apply` action.

The following section allows you to review the core Terraform resources more closely.

<br />

### Provider

The **provider.tf** file contains the Terraform providers and their respective versions. The tutorial uses two providers - the Spectro Cloud Terraform provider and the TLS Terraform provider. Note how the project name is specified in the `provider "spectrocloud" {}` block. You can change the target project by changing the value specified in the `project_name` parameter.

<br />


```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    spectrocloud = {
      version = ">= 0.13.1"
      source  = "spectrocloud/spectrocloud"
    }
    tls = {
      source  = "hashicorp/tls"
      version = "4.0.4"
    }
  }
}

provider "spectrocloud" {
  project_name = "Default"
}
```

The next file you should become familiar with is the **cluster-profiles.tf** file.

### Cluster Profile

The Spectro Cloud Terraform provider has several resources available for use. When creating a cluster profile, use `spectrocloud_cluster_profile`.
This resource can be used to customize all layers of a cluster profile. You can specify all the different packs and versions to use and add a manifest or Helm chart.


In the **cluster-profiles.tf** file, the cluster profile resource is declared three times. Each instance of the resource is for a specific cloud provider. Using the AWS cluster profile as an example, note how the **cluster-profiles.tf** file uses `pack {}` blocks to specify each layer of the profile. The order in which you arrange contents of the `pack {}` blocks plays an important role, as each layer maps to the core infrastructure in a cluster profile. 

The first listed `pack {}` block must be the OS, followed by Kubernetes, the container network interface, and the container storage interface. The first `pack {}` block in the list equates to the bottom layer of the cluster profile. Ensure you define the bottom layer of the cluster profile - the OS layer -  first in the list of `pack {}` blocks.

<br />

```terraform
resource "spectrocloud_cluster_profile" "aws-profile" {
  name        = "tf-aws-profile"
  description = "A basic cluster profile for AWS"
  tags        = concat(var.tags, ["env:aws"])
  cloud       = "aws"
  type        = "cluster"

  pack {
    name   = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_ubuntu.name
    tag    = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_ubuntu.version
    uid    = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_ubuntu.id
    values = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_ubuntu.values
  }

  pack {
    name   = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_k8s.name
    tag    = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_k8s.version
    uid    = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_k8s.id
    values = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_k8s.values
  }

  pack {
    name   = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_cni.name
    tag    = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_cni.version
    uid    = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_cni.id
    values = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_cni.values
  }

  pack {
    name   = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_csi.name
    tag    = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_csi.version
    uid    = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_csi.id
    values = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_csi.values
  }

  pack {
    name   = "hello-universe"
    type   = "manifest"
    tag    = "1.0.0"
    values = ""
    manifest {
      name    = "hello-universe"
      content = file("manifests/hello-universe.yaml")
    }
  }
}
```

The last `pack {}` block contains a manifest file with all the Kubernetes configurations for the [Hello Universe](https://github.com/spectrocloud/hello-universe) application. Including the application in the profile ensures the application is installed during cluster deployment. If you wonder what all the data resources are for, head to the next section to review them.


### Data Resources

You may have noticed that each `pack {}` block contains references to a data resource. 

<br />


```terraform
  pack {
    name   = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_csi.name
    tag    = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_csi.version
    uid    = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_csi.id
    values = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_csi.values
  }
```
<br />

[Data resources](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/data-sources) are used to perform read actions in Terraform. The Spectro Cloud Terraform provider exposes several data resources to help you make your Terraform code more dynamic. The data resource used in the cluster profile is `spectrocloud_pack`. This resource enables you to query Palette for information about a specific pack. You can get information about the pack using the data resource such as unique ID, registry ID, available versions, and the pack's YAML values.

Below is the data resource used to query Palette for information about the Kubernetes pack for version `1.24.10`.

<br />

```terraform
data "spectrocloud_pack" "aws_k8s" {
  name    = "kubernetes"
  version = "1.24.10"
}
```

Using the data resource, you avoid manually typing in the parameter values required by the cluster profile's `pack {}` block.

<br />

### Cluster

The **clusters.tf** file contains the definitions for deploying a host cluster to one of the cloud providers. To create a host cluster, you must use a cluster resource for the cloud provider you are targeting.

In this tutorial, the following Terraform cluster resources are used.

<br />

| Terraform Resource | Platform |
|---|---|
| [`spectrocloud_cluster_aws`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs/resources/cluster_aws) | AWS | 
| [`spectrocloud_cluster_azure`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs/resources/cluster_azure) | Azure |
| [`spectrocloud_cluster_gcp`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs/resources/cluster_gcp) | GCP |

Using the `spectrocloud_cluster_azure` resource in this tutorial as an example, note how the resource accepts a set of parameters. When deploying a cluster, you can change the same parameters in the Palette user interface (UI). You can learn more about each parameter by reviewing the resource documentation page hosted in the Terraform registry.

<br />

```terraform
resource "spectrocloud_cluster_azure" "cluster" {
  name             = "azure-cluster"
  tags             = concat(var.tags, ["env:azure"])
  cloud_account_id = data.spectrocloud_cloudaccount_azure.account[0].id

  cloud_config {
    subscription_id = var.azure_subscription_id
    resource_group  = var.azure_resource_group
    region          = var.azure-region
    ssh_key         = tls_private_key.tutorial_ssh_key[0].public_key_openssh
  }

  cluster_profile {
    id = spectrocloud_cluster_profile.azure-profile[0].id
  }

  machine_pool {
    control_plane           = true
    control_plane_as_worker = true
    name                    = "master-pool"
    count                   = var.azure_master_nodes.count
    instance_type           = var.azure_master_nodes.instance_type
    azs                     = var.azure_master_nodes.azs
    is_system_node_pool     = var.azure_master_nodes.is_system_node_pool
    disk {
      size_gb = var.azure_master_nodes.disk_size_gb
      type    = "Standard_LRS"
    }
  }

  machine_pool {
    name                = "worker-basic"
    count               = var.azure_worker_nodes.count
    instance_type       = var.azure_worker_nodes.instance_type
    azs                 = var.azure_worker_nodes.azs
    is_system_node_pool = var.azure_worker_nodes.is_system_node_pool
  }

  timeouts {
    create = "30m"
    delete = "15m"
  }
}
```
## Deploy Cluster

To deploy a cluster using Terraform, you must first modify the **terraform.tfvars** file. Open the **terraform.tfvars** file in the editor of your choice, and locate the cloud provider you will use to deploy a host cluster.

To simplify the process, we added a toggle variable in the Terraform template, that you can use to select the deployment environment. Each cloud provider has a section in the template that contains all the variables you must populate. Variables to populate are identified with `REPLACE_ME`.

In the example AWS section below, you would change `deploy-aws = false` to `deploy-aws = true` to deploy to AWS. Additionally, you would replace all the variables with a value `REPLACE_ME`. You can also update the values for nodes in the master pool or worker pool.

<br />

```terraform
###########################
# AWS Deployment Settings
############################
deploy-aws = false # Set to true to deploy to AWS

aws-cloud-account-name = "REPLACE_ME"
aws-region             = "REPLACE_ME"
aws-key-pair-name      = "REPLACE_ME"

aws_master_nodes = {
  count              = "1"
  control_plane      = true
  instance_type      = "m4.2xlarge"
  disk_size_gb       = "60"
  availability_zones = ["REPLACE_ME"] # If you want to deploy to multiple AZs, add them here
}

aws_worker_nodes = {
  count              = "1"
  control_plane      = false
  instance_type      = "m4.2xlarge"
  disk_size_gb       = "60"
  availability_zones = ["REPLACE_ME"] # If you want to deploy to multiple AZs, add them here
}
```

When you are done making the required changes, issue the following command to initialize Terraform.

<br />

```shell
terraform init
```

Next, issue the `plan` command to preview the changes.

<br />

```shell
terraform plan
```


Output:
```shell
Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

If you change the desired cloud provider's toggle variable to `true,` you will receive an output message that two new resources will be created. The two resources are your cluster profile and the host cluster.

To deploy all the resources, use the `apply` command.

<br />

```shell
terraform apply -auto-approve
```


### Verify the Profile


To check out the cluster profile creation in Palette, log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com), and from the left **Main Menu** click on **Profiles**. Locate the cluster profile with the name pattern `tf-[cloud provier]-profile`. Click on the cluster profile to review its details, such as layers, packs, and versions.

<br />

## Validate

When the cluster deploys, you can access the Hello Universe application.
From the cluster's **Overview** page, click on the URL for port **:8080** next to the **hello-universe-service** in the **Services** row. This URL will take you to the application landing page. 

<br />


<WarningBox>

It can take up to three minutes for DNS to properly resolve the public load balancer URL. We recommend waiting a few moments before clicking on the service URL to prevent the browser from caching an unresolved DNS request.

</WarningBox>

Welcome to Hello Universe, a demo application to help you learn more about Palette and its features. Feel free to click on the logo to increase the counter and for a fun image change.

You have deployed your first application to a cluster managed by Palette through Terraform. Your first application is a single container application with no upstream dependencies.


## Cleanup

Use the following steps to clean up the resources you created for the tutorial. Use the `destroy` command to remove all the resources you created through Terraform.

<br />

```shell
terraform destroy --auto-approve
```

Output:
```shell
Destroy complete! Resources: 2 destroyed.
```

<br />

<InfoBox>

If a cluster remains in the delete phase for over 15 minutes, it becomes eligible for force delete. To trigger a force delete, navigate to the cluster’s details page and click on **Settings**. Click on **Force Delete Cluster** to delete the cluster. Palette automatically removes clusters stuck in the cluster deletion phase for over 24 hours.

</InfoBox>


If you are using the tutorial container and want to exit the container, type `exit` in your terminal session and press the **Enter** key. Next, issue the following command to stop the container.

<br />

```shell
docker stop tutorialContainer && \
docker rmi --force ghcr.io/spectrocloud/tutorials:1.0.4
```

# Wrap-up

In this tutorial, you created a cluster profile, which is a template that contains the core layers required to deploy a host cluster. You then deployed a host cluster onto your preferred cloud service provider. After the cluster deployed, you updated the profile by adding the Hello Universe application and applied the updates to the host cluster.

Palette assures consistency across cluster deployments through cluster profiles. Palette also enables you to quickly deploy applications to a Kubernetes environment with little or no prior Kubernetes knowledge. In a matter of minutes, you were able to provision a new Kubernetes cluster and deploy an application.

We encourage you to check out the [Deploy an Application using Palette Dev Engine](/devx/apps/deploy-app) tutorial to learn more about Palette. Palette Dev Engine can help you deploy applications more quickly through the usage of [virtual clusters](/glossary-all#palettevirtualcluster).
