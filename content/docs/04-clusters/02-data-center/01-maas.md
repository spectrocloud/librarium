# Overview

Palette enables seamless integration with Canonical MAAS, allowing you to deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters directly on bare metal servers. Palette achieves this through the Private Cloud Gateway (PCG), establishing a secure connection from the internal network to the internet-accessible Palette instance and effectively bypassing NAT gateways and firewalls.


Palette also supports self-hosted deployment of Kubernetes clusters in the MAAS environment, allowing direct access to MAAS through a private network without the need for a PCG. This setup ensures network connectivity and flexibility in managing Kubernetes clusters on bare metal servers, either through a VPN or by directly accessing the Palette instance in a private network.
