# Overview 

When you install the Private Cloud Gateway (PCG), a cloud account is auto-created in every project in Palette. You can use this cloud account to create clusters at either the tenant or the project level. If desired, you can create additional cloud accounts that reference specific PCGs. 

# Prerequisites

- An installed PCG if you do not have a direct connection to the MAAS environment. Review [Install and Manage MAAS Private Cloud Gateway](/clusters/data-center/maas/install-manage-maas-pcg) for guidance.

  If are self-hosting Palette and have a direct connection to the MAAS environment, you can select **Use System Private Gateway**. To learn more about when you would use Palette's PCG or the System Private Gateway, refer to the [Architecture](/clusters/data-center/maas/architecture) page.



- An active [MAAS API key](https://maas.io/docs/api-authentication-reference) which can be generated in the MAAS web console under **My Preferences** > **API keys**. The following is an example key:

  ``APn53wz232ZwBMxDp5:MHZIbUp3e4DJTjZEKg:mdEv33WAG536MhNC8mIywNLtjcDTnFAQ``

 For details, refer to the MAAS document on [how to add an API key](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-manage-user-accounts#heading--api-key).
