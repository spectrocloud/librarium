# Overview 

Palette supports creating and managing Kubernetes clusters deployed to a MAAS account. This section guides you on how to create a Kubernetes cluster in MAAS that is managed by Palette.

# Prerequisites

- An installed Private Cloud Gateway (PCG). Review [Install and Manage MAAS Gateway](/clusters/data-center/maas/install-manage-maas-pcg) for guidance.


- A MAAS account registered in Palette. Refer to the [Register and Manage MAAS Cloud Accounts](/clusters/data-center/maas/register-manage-maas-cloud-accounts) if you need to register a MAAS account in Palette.


- A cluster profile for the MAAS environment. Review [Cluster Profiles](/cluster-profiles) for more information. 

# Deploy a MAAS cluster

To deploy a new MAAS cluster:

<br />

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com) as a tenant admin.


2. Navigate to the **Main Menu** and click **Clusters**. Then click the **Add New Cluster** button.


3. Click **Deploy New Cluster** on the Create a New Cluster page.


4. Select **MAAS** and click the **Start MAAS Configuration** button.


5. Provide basic cluster information: **Cluster name**, **Description**, and **Tags**.


6. Select your MAAS cloud account from the **drop-down Menu** and click **Next**.


7. Select the cluster profile for your MAAS cluster. 


8. Review and override pack parameters as desired and click **Next**. By default, parameters for all packs are set with values defined in the cluster profile.


9. Select a domain from the **Domain drop-down Menu** and click **Next**. 


10. Configure the master and worker node pools. The following input fields apply to MAAS master and worker node pools. For a description of input fields that are common across target platforms refer to the [Node Pools](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/clusters/cluster-management/node-pool) management page. Click **Next** when you are done.

    <br />

    #### Master Pool configuration

    - Cloud configuration:

        - Resource Pool: The MAAS resource pool from which to select available servers for deployment. Filter available servers to only those that have at least the amount of CPU and Memory selected.

    <br />

    #### Worker Pool configuration

    - Cloud configuration:

        - Resource Pool: The MAAS resource pool from which to select available servers for deployment. Filter available servers to only those that have at least the amount of CPU and Memory selected.


11. You can configure the following cluster management features now if needed, or you can do it later:

    - Manage machines
    - Schedule scans
    - Schedule backups
    - Role-based access control (RBAC)
    - Location 


12. Review settings and deploy the cluster. 


## Validate

You can validate your cluster is available by reviewing the cluster details page. Navigate to the left **Main Menu** and click **Clusters**. The **Clusters** page lists all available clusters that Palette manages. Select the cluster to review its details page. Ensure the **Cluster Status** field contains the value **Running**.

<br />

# Delete a MAAS Cluster

When you delete a MAAS cluster, all machines and associated storage disks that were created for the cluster are removed. 

Follow these steps to delete a MAAS cluster.

<br />

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com) as a tenant admin.


2. Navigate to the **Main Menu** and click **Clusters**. 


3. Select the cluster you want to delete.


4. Click the **Settings drop-down Menu**, and choose **Delete**.

The cluster status is updated to **Deleting** while cluster resources are being deleted. When all resources are successfully deleted, the cluster status is updated to **Deleted** and the cluster is removed from the list. The delete operation returns the edge hosts to the **Ready** state. All the artifacts related to the Kubernetes distribution are removed.

<br />

## Force Delete a Cluster

If a cluster is stuck in the Deletion state for a minimum of 15 minutes it becomes eligible for force deletion. You can force delete a cluster from the tenant and project admin scopes. To force delete a cluster, follow the same steps outlined in [Delete a MAAS Cluster](/clusters/data-center/maas/create-manage-maas-clusters#deleteamaascluster). After 15 minutes, a **Force Delete Cluster** option is available in the **Settings drop-down menu**. The drop-down menu will provide you with an estimated remaining duration before the force deletion becomes available.

<br />

<WarningBox>

A force delete can result in Palette-provisioned resources being missed during the removal process. Verify that any MAAS machines associated with the cluster have been released. Failure to remove provisioned resources can result in unexpected costs.

# Next Steps

Now that youâ€™ve deployed a MAAS cluster, you can start developing and deploying applications to your cluster. We recommend you review the Day-2 operations and become familiar with the cluster management tasks. Check out the [Manage Clusters](/clusters/cluster-management) documentation to learn more about Day-2 responsibilities.
