# Overview

Palette [Virtual Clusters](/clusters/palette-virtual-clusters) are a capability that cluster groups support and that you can enable when creating a cluster group. By default, the virtual cluster settings in a cluster group disable disk backups. You can back up all the volumes within a virtual cluster using the following steps. 

# Prerequisites

* A project or tenant backup location. Refer to the [cluster backup and restore](/clusters/cluster-management/backup-restore#clusterbackupandrestore) document to learn how to configure a backup location.

* Cluster group modification [permissions](/user-management/palette-rbac).

* A cluster group. Review the [create a cluster group](/clusters/cluster-groups/create-cluster-group) for additional guidance.


<InfoBox>

You can also enable virtual cluster disk backup during the cluster group creation process.

# Enable Backup for Virtual Clusters

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com).


2. Navigate to the left **Main Menu** and select **Cluster Groups**.


3. Select a cluster group to enable virtual cluster disk backup.


4. Click **Settings** and expand the **Settings** Menu.


5. To enable disk backup you need to change the following configurations in the **Advanced Config** section.

    - Set `syncer.extraArgs.rewrite-host-paths` to `true`
    ```yaml
    syncer:
    extraArgs:
        - --rewrite-host-paths=true
    ```
    - Set `hostpathMapper.enabled` to `true`
    ```yaml
    hostpathMapper:
        enabled: true
    ```
    - Set `podSecurityStandard` to `privileged`
    ```yaml
    isolation:
    podSecurityStandard: privileged
    ```

<WarningBox>

Setting the `podSecurityStandard` to `privileged` can introduce privilege escalations. We recommend you discuss this with your security system administrator.

</WarningBox>

7. Save your changes.


All virtual clusters deployed in this cluster group will now include disk storage during backup operations.

# Validate


You can validate the disk backups are occurring by deploying a virtual cluster and taking a backup. 

1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com).


2. Deploy a virtual cluster in your cluster group that has the disk backup settings enabled. Refer to the [Deploy a Virtual Cluster to a Cluster Group](/clusters/palette-virtual-clusters/deploy-virtual-cluster) guide to learn how to deploy Palette Virtual clusters.


3. Create a backup of your virtual cluster and include all disks. Use the [Create a Cluster Backup](/clusters/cluster-management/backup-restore#createaclusterbackup) guide for additional guidance.


4. Access the backup location's blob storage and review the backup files.
