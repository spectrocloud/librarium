# New Clusters 

Spectro Cloud supports provisioning and end-to-end lifecycle management of Kubernetes clusters (workload clusters) on various public clouds, private clouds, bare metal servers (installed in data centers)  as well as on edge appliances (isolated bare metal servers or virtual machines installed on edge locations such as hospitals, restaurants, grocery stores, etc.) On public clouds, Spectro Cloud supports provisioning new clusters using the cloud provider's infrastructure by provisioning new VMs for control plane and worker pools as well as through their managed Kubernetes services such as EKS, AKS etc. Provisioning of clusters on private environments like VMware, OpenStack etc requires a Private Cloud Gateway (PCG) to be installed for Spectro Cloud to be able to install Kubernetes clusters. Deploying edge clusters (clusters installed on edge appliances), requires a Private Cloud Gateway - Edge (PCG-Edge) to be installed on the appliances for Spectro Cloud to discover the appliance and provision workload clusters on them.

<InfoBox>
Workload clusters are instantiated from cloud specific <Tooltip trigger={<u>cluster profiles</u>}><a href="/cluster-profiles">Cluster profiles</a> are instantiated templates that are created with pre-configured layers/components needed for cluster deployments.</Tooltip>. You can use one of the cluster profiles provided out-of-the-box or create a new one.
