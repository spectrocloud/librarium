# On-Premises Installation

The Palette SaaS platform is also available as an entirely on-prem and customer managed offering. The on-prem version can be installed in customer data centers to manage Kubernetes clusters. Palette on-prem is available in two modes:

## Quick Start Mode

Single node installation of the platform, ideal for PoC environments.

## Enterprise Mode

Highly available multi-node installation typically for production purposes.


Palette provides the platform installer to enable quick start mode and enterprise mode.
