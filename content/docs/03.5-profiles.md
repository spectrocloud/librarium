# Overview

Profiles consist of preconfigured layers that drive consistency across workload cluster deployments while also allowing you to customize cluster deployments based on your requirements. 

Palette uses the following types of profiles. 

<br />

- **Cluster profiles** - Cluster profiles contain the core requirements for workload cluster deployments within a tenant: an Operating System (OS), Kubernetes layer, Network, and Storage. Check out the [Cluster Profiles]() guide to learn more. 


- **Add-on profiles** - Add-on profiles enhance cluster functionality. You can create add-on profile and apply them to clusters along with the cluster profiles, or you can add layers directly to the cluster profile. Add-on profiles apply to a single tenant. To learn more, refer to the [Add-On Profiles]() guide.


- **System profiles** - Used to bootstrap an edge appliance with an initial set of virtual and containerized applications. System profiles span multiple tenants. Refer to [System Profiles]() to learn more.


<!-- with additional layers you can add to profiles -->

<!-- Profiles consist of preconfigured layers, which can be packs, Helm Charts, or manifests. are like templates that drive consistency across workload cluster deployments.  while also allowing you to customize cluster deployments based on your requirements. System profiles provide input to the edge systems. Profiles consist of preconfigured layers, which can be packs, Helm Charts, or manifests.  -->

## Profile Layers

Each profile layer provides a specific functionality. Profile layers can be packs, Helm Charts, or manifests.

|     **Layer**      |      **Description**      |
|--------------------|---------------------------|
| Palette Packs  | Packs are built using integration-specific templates. We maintain a public registry of Palette Packs that are available to all tenants. Check out our [Packs List](/integrations) reference to learn more. |
| Helm Charts    | Helm charts are a collection of Kubernetes resource files capable of deploying various services. Palette provides a public Helm registry and a private Helm registry. Additionally, your organization can add any public or private Helm registries to Palette to leverage charts from those registries. Palette promotes Container Storage Interface (CSI) and Container Network Interface (CNI) layers to be added as Helm Charts from customized Helm registries and linked to Spectro Registry packs. <<< COME BACK TO THIS SENTENCE >>> |
| Manifests      | In Palette, you can construct App Profile layers using raw manifests to provision Kubernetes resources that are unavailable in Palette or Helm Charts. Manifests provide a pass-through mechanism to orchestrate Kubernetes resources in a cluster. For example, specific integrations may require the creation of secrets or Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). By attaching a manifest file to a layer in a cluster profile, you can provision these additional resources. |

<!-- ## Profile Stack

As you add layers to the cluster profile, you are building the profile stack. Layers in the profile stack can be packs, Helm Charts, and manifests that contain configuration information. -->

<!-- Palette Packs - content packages are built using Spectro Cloud's proprietary content format. Spectro Cloud maintains a public registry of Palette Packs that are available to all tenants.

Helm Charts - These charts are a collection of Kubernetes resource files capable of deploying various services. Palette provides some stable public Helm registries out-of-the-box. You can also add any public or private Helm registries and leverage charts from them. Palette promotes Container Storage Interface (CSI) and Container Network Interface (CNI) layers to be added as Helm Charts from customized Helm registries and linked to Spectro Registry packs.

Manifests - In Palette, you can construct App Profile layers using raw manifests to provision Kubernetes resources that are unavailable in Palette or Helm Charts. Manifests provide a pass-through mechanism to orchestrate Kubernetes resources in a cluster. For example, specific integrations may require the creation of secrets or Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). By attaching a manifest file to a layer in a cluster profile, you can provision these additional resources. -->
