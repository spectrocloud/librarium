# Overview

Profiles use one or more preconfigured layers, which can be packs, Helm Charts, or manifests. Profiles are templates that drive consistency across workload cluster deployments. You can create as many profiles as needed, and you can apply them to multiple clusters. This section describes the different profile types and how to manage them. 

Below are three kinds of profiles Palette uses. 

- **Cluster profiles** - Contain the requirements for workload cluster deployments. Cluster profiles apply to a single tenant.

- **Add-on profiles** - Enhance cluster profile functionality by allowing the addition of various layers. Add-on profiles apply to a single tenant tenant. 

- **System profiles** - Used to bootstrap an edge appliance with an initial set of virtual and containerized applications. System profiles span multiple tenants.


Clusters you ceate in Palette require a Core Infrastructure or Full cluster profile, which both include the core layers that consist of an operating system (OS), Kubernetes layer, Network, and Storage. You can create optional Add-on profiles or add on to the Core Infrastructure profile.

#### Core Infrastructure Cluster Profile

You create a Core Infrastructure cluster profile using the four Core Infrastructure layers: the OS, Kubernetes, the networking, and the storage layers. These profiles are environment-specific. The first layer in the Core Infrastructure is always the OS layer.

#### Add-On Cluster Profile

Add-on cluster profiles are used to enhance cluster functionality. An Add-on cluster profile consists of various integrations and can be constructed using layers such as the following.

- System apps
- Authentication
- Security
- Monitoring
- Logging
- Ingress
- Load balancer
- Helm Charts

<<< SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER >>>

#### Full Cluster Profile

A Full cluster profile consists of the Core Infrastructure layers and as many Add-on layers as needed. The Core Infrastructure layers are cloud-specific.

## Profile Stack

As you add layers to the cluster profile, you are building the profile stack. Layers in the profile stack can be packs, Helm Charts, and manifests that contain configuration information.

<!-- Palette Packs - content packages are built using Spectro Cloud's proprietary content format. Spectro Cloud maintains a public registry of Palette Packs that are available to all tenants.

Helm Charts - These charts are a collection of Kubernetes resource files capable of deploying various services. Palette provides some stable public Helm registries out-of-the-box. You can also add any public or private Helm registries and leverage charts from them. Palette promotes Container Storage Interface (CSI) and Container Network Interface (CNI) layers to be added as Helm Charts from customized Helm registries and linked to Spectro Registry packs.

Manifests - In Palette, you can construct App Profile layers using raw manifests to provision Kubernetes resources that are unavailable in Palette or Helm Charts. Manifests provide a pass-through mechanism to orchestrate Kubernetes resources in a cluster. For example, specific integrations may require the creation of secrets or Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). By attaching a manifest file to a layer in a cluster profile, you can provision these additional resources. -->
