# Free Cloud Credit with Palette

Palette provides a cloud account—with required credentials—for user deployments. This free cloud credit is offered to customers who do not have access to a cloud account and want to try Palette, before committing to the Palette platform. Perhaps a customer finds themselves without sufficient permissions to input their existing cloud credentials or is exploring new ways to manage their services. The Free Cloud Credit, granted through the Palette account, is a great way to begin exploring the Palette platform. 


## Request a Free Cloud Account

To request an authorization to the Spectro Cloud Free Cloud Credit program, connect via the [Slack Spectro Cloud Community](https://join.slack.com/t/spectrocloudcommunity/shared_invite/zt-g8gfzrhf-cKavsGD_myOh30K24pImLA) or [email](mailto:developer@spectrocloud.com) and ask about the Free Cloud Credit program. A $100 of free cloud credit will be granted to use with the Spectro Cloud's Palette platform. The user is encouraged to monitor the usage and expenditure percentage through Palette, and as they reach the conclusion of the credit usage, a message will remind the user of the Usage Status.


## Managing a Free Cloud Account

The Free Cloud Credit ends when the $100 of the free cloud credit, granted by Spectro Cloud is consumed. At that time, all resources created during the trial period will cease services and clusters will be marked for deletion and will be lost, so make sure to back up as needed. Reminders will be sent along the way at the 50%, 90%, and 100% consumption stage sharing the state of the free cloud usage.


## Upgrade to a Paid Cloud Account

Upgrade to a Cloud Account at any time after trying the Free Cloud Credit service. Create your own Cloud Account and replace the Free Cloud Credit with your own Cloud Account information.
