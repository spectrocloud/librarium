# Try Palette for Free

**Palette Free Tier** encourages new users to explore Palette, without having to make a purchase decision, before they are ready. With unlimited kilo-Core-hour usage the first month, there is full access to the Spectro Cloud Palette Platform to create, deploy, and manage Palette resources. 

The second month and every month thereafter, the customer is granted a complimentary 25 kilo-Core-hour (kCh) to use freely to manage up to five Kubernetes clusters with Palette. 

There is the choice to continue in the Free Tier, so long as you stay under the 25 kCh consumption. Go over the usage limit of 25 kCh, and the clusters remain visible, but convert to Read-Only. Palette sends alert messages to users when 25 kCh is crossed, and if more than five active clusters are launched further deployments will be restricted. Enter a payment and all usage and capabilities are restored. 


## Free Cloud Credit with Palette

Palette provides a cloud account—with required credentials—for user deployments. This free cloud credit is offered to customers who do not have access to a cloud account and want to try Palette, before committing to the Palette platform. Perhaps a customer finds themselves without sufficient permissions to input their existing cloud credentials or is exploring new ways to manage their services. The Free Cloud Credit, granted through the Palette account, is a great way to begin exploring the Palette platform. 


## Request a Free Cloud Account

To request an authorization to the Spectro Cloud Free Cloud Credit program, connect via the [Slack Spectro Cloud Community](https://join.slack.com/t/spectrocloudcommunity/shared_invite/zt-g8gfzrhf-cKavsGD_myOh30K24pImLA) or [email](mailto:developer@spectrocloud.com) and ask about the Free Cloud Credit program. A $100 of free cloud credit will be granted to use with the Spectro Cloud's Palette platform. The user is encouraged to monitor the usage and expenditure percentage through Palette, and as they reach the conclusion of the credit usage, a message will remind the user of the Usage Status.


## Managing a Free Cloud Account

The Free Cloud Credit ends when the $100 of the free cloud credit, granted by Spectro Cloud is consumed. At that time, all resources created during the trial period will cease services and clusters will be marked for deletion and will be lost, so make sure to back up as needed. Reminders will be sent along the way at the 50%, 90%, and 100% consumption stage sharing the state of the free cloud usage.


### Upgrade to a Paid Cloud Account

Upgrade to a Cloud Account at any time after trying the Free Cloud Credit service. Create your own Cloud Account and replace the Free Cloud Credit with your own Cloud Account information.


# Kilo-Core-hour Calculations

Usage is calculated as a concept of kilo-Core-hour or kCh. This is a measurement of the number of CPU Cores multiplied by Time. For instance, for a 4-node cluster which has 16 CPU cores each, one day of management will equate to 4 x 16 CPU cores x 24 hours = 1.54 kCh.
