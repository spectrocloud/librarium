# Palette Onboarding Workflow

Palette has a very well-organized product onboarding process to streamline the user product adoption. The two major steps of our onboarding workflow are:
* Product Tour
* Palette Experience

## Product Tour

Once the user logins to our Platform, we start the onboarding process with a product tour - An introduction to the our platform, to familiarize the users with our Palette features. 

## Start your  Palette Experience

The product tour is followed by a Palette experience session.  Here we make sure that our users are guided through a successful deployment pipeline in their first use instead of them just figuring things out along the way towards cluster creation.  The major integrants of this session are as follows:

* [Create New Cluster](/clusters/new-clusters#newclusters)
  * To create a new cluster from scratch using any cloud environment or bare metal.
  * System-level cluster profile included for the users to explore the Palette functionalities easier and faster. 
* [Import Cluster](/clusters/brownfield-clusters#overview)
  * Bring your own cluster into Palette in 2 easy steps.
* OOTB Configurations:
  * Try one of our out-of-the-box cluster profile configurations applicable on your own cluster or in our sandbox env.

Once the user experience session is finished, the user will be familiar with Palette's workflow and deployment pipeline. This section of the document is a quick start to the deployment process with simple instructions to jump start the Palette journey. The different Palette features and Day-2 operations are detailed in the remainder of this documentation site.
