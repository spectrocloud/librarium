# Overview

The Spectro VM Dashboard supports standard power operations for virtual machines (VMs): 

<br />

- **Start**


- **Stop** 


- **Pause** 


- **Restart** 
 

Live migration, snapshots, and cloning are also supported.

You can access standard VM operations in two ways:

<br />

- From the **Virtual Machines** tab, click the **three-dot Menu** in the row of the VM you want to perform actions on.


- Select a VM and click **Actions**.
