# Overview

Paletteâ€™s VM Management solution allows you to deploy and manage Virtual Machines (VMs) alongside containerized applications.


There are three ways you can create a new VM:


<br />

- Deploy a VM from a template. Palette provides out-of-the-box templates, or your organization may provide templates. For the latter, refer to the [Create a VM Template](/vm-management/create-manage-vm/create-vm-template) guide.


- Create an empty VM and install the Operating System (OS) using a standard method, such as a Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) or optical disk image (ISO).


- Clone an existing VM.

Administrators can also import VMs from their existing VMware vSphere environment into Palette.

Although no additional components are required in VMs, the **QEMU Guest Agent** is an optional component that runs inside a VM and provides runtime information. 

Additionally, Virtio is a virtualization standard for network and disk device drivers where only the guest's device driver knows it is deployed in a virtual environment, and cooperates with the hypervisor. This enables guests to receive high performance network and disk operations and provides most of the performance benefits of paravirtualization.

<br />

We recommend installing ``qemu-guest-agent`` to improve VM management. We also recommend installing Virtio drivers to ensure you can use the paravirtualized hardware properly.
