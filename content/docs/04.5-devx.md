# Overview

Palette provides two different modes for deploying and managing applications. The first mode is *Cluster Mode* - this mode enables you to create, deploy, and manage Kubernetes clusters and applications. The second mode is *App Mode* - a mode optimized for a simpler and streamlined developer experience that allows you to only focus on the building, maintenance, testing, deployment, and monitoring of your applications.

You can leverage Spectro Cloud's complementary managed Kubernetes cluster when using App Mode. The complementary resources have a limit of 12 vCPU, 16 GiB of memory, and 20 GiB of free storage. Alternatively, you may deploy applications on Kubernetes clusters that belong to your organization and are managed by Palette.

Check out the in-depth explanation of [App Mode and Cluster Mode](/introduction/palette-modes) to learn more about each mode.


<br />


## Supported Platforms

App Mode is available for the following Palette platforms.

| Platform | Supported | Palette Version |
|---|----|---|
| SaaS | ✅| `v3.0.0` or greater. |
| Self-hosted | ✅ | `3.4.0` or greater. |
| Airgap Self-hosted | ❌| N/A.


## Manage Resources

The PDE dashboard provides a snapshot of resource utilization in your PDE environment. You can keep track of the resource utilization in your PDE environment without having to navigate to different views. The dashboard displays the following information.
<br />

* The number of apps deployed.


* The number of virtual clusters and their respective status.


* The aggregate resource utilization at both the tenant and system levels for these resources.
    * Virtual clusters
    * CPU
    * Memory
    * Storage


* The number of app profiles available.

## Automation Support

You can manage PDE resources through the [Palette API](/api/introduction), [Spectro Cloud Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs), and the Palette CLI. Download the Palette CLI from the [Downloads](/spectro-downloads#palettecli) page to start programmatically using PDE.

Check out the [Palette CLI](/palette-cli/install-palette-cli) for installation guidance. 

# Get Started

To get started with App Mode, give the tutorial [Deploy an Application using Palette Dev Engine](/devx/apps/deploy-app) a try so that you can learn how to use App Mode with Palette Dev Engine.
