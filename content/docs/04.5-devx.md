# Overview

Palette provides a developer persona of the Palette operations in addition to the DevOps persona of creating, deploying, and managing applications in Palette. This persona is called Palette Dev Engine (PDE); the experience developers have while building, maintaining, testing, deploying, and monitoring applications through Palette. A developer can easily switch between these two personas - the **DevOps** and **Palette Dev Engine (PDE)** - through the Palette UI. We offer the PDE from two wide perspectives:

<br />

* As a free offering from Palette for Developers to [Land and Expand](/devx/devx-free-user)

* For [Enterprise Developers](/devx/enterprise-user)

## Login Options

Palette provides two options of developer log in to the Palette Dev Engine console:

<br />

### Social Sign-In 

The developer can sign in directly to the Palette Dev Engine console using their social sign-in credentials, such as Google or GitHub. These developers are at benefit from using our complimentary resources to either:

<br />

* Provision a nested cluster to get full access to all the namespaces

* Deploy an application using an app profile that would spin up a nested cluster

In either case, they are governed by the quota set by Palette. There is no limit to the number of application profiles they can be modelled.

### Enable Social Sign-In

To enable social Sign In the user as a Palette tenant admin need to set up SSO authentication in the Palette console.

* Log in to the Palette console as a Tenant Admin.


* Go to `Tenant Settings` and select `SSO` from the left main menu.


* From **Manange SSO** go to `Auth Providers` and toggle the `Enable Provider Login` button.


* Now select the social sign in platform the developers wants to use.


* Log out of the Palette console and login selecting the social sign in platform enabled in the previous step. The log in can progress in two ways:
  * If there is no Tenant existing in that log in, Palette will create a new Tenant and a new organization and then login to that tenant console.
  * If a Tenant already exist in that log in then Palette will directly log in the developer in to that Tenant console.
 
<br />

### Palette Sign-In

Log in to the Palette console using the Palette sign-in credentials and switch between Palette Dev Engine and DevOps console to take full advantage of the Palette Platform. For this use case the developer can create the resources under their tenant scope as well as make use of the system scope resources. They can even launch the applications on the host cluster groups at their enterprise environment using the Palette nested clusters.
