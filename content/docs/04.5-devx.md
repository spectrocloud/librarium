# Overview

Palette provides a developer persona of the Palette operations in addition to the DevOps persona of creating, deploying, and managing applications in Palette. This persona is called Palette Dev Engine (PDE); the experience developers have while building, maintaining, testing, deploying, and monitoring applications through Palette. A developer can easily switch between these two personas - the **DevOps** and **Palette Dev Engine (PDE)** - through the Palette UI. We offer the PDE from two wide perspectives:

<br />

* As a free offering from Palette for Developers to [Land and Expand](/devx/devx-free-user)

* For [Enterprise Developers](/devx/enterprise-user)

## Login Options

Palette provides two options of developer log in to the Palette Dev Engine console:

<br />

### Social Sign-In 

The developer can sign in directly to the Palette Dev Engine console using their social sign-in credentials, such as Google or GitHub. These developers are at benefit from using our complimentary resources to either:

<br />

* Provision a nested cluster to get full access to all the namespaces

* Deploy an application using an app profile that would spin up a nested cluster

In either case, they are governed by the quota set by Palette. There is no limit to the number of application profiles they can be modelled.

<br />

### Palette Sign-In

Log in to the Palette console using the Palette sign-in credentials and switch between Palette Dev Engine and DevOps console to take full advantage of the Palette Platform. For this use case the developer can create the resources under their tenant scope as well as make use of the system scope resources. They can even launch the applications on the host cluster groups at their enterprise environment using the Palette nested clusters.
