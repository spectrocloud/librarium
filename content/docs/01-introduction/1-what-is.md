# What is Palette?
Palette is a complete and integrated platform that enables organizations to easily manage the entire lifecycle of any combination of new or existing, simple or complex, small or large Kubernetes environments, whether in a data center or the cloud.
 
With a unique approach to managing multiple clusters, Palette gives IT teams complete control, visibility, and production-scale efficiencies to provide developers with highly-curated Kubernetes stacks and tools based on their specific needs, with granular governance and enterprise-grade security.

## What Makes Spectro Cloud Different?
 
### Full-Stack Management
Unlike rigid and prepackaged Kubernetes solutions, Palette allows users to construct flexible stacks from OS, Kubernetes, CNI, and CSI to additional add-on application services. As a result, the entire stack - not just the infrastructure - of Kubernetes is deployed, updated, and managed as one unit, without split responsibility from virtual machines, base OS, Kubernetes infra, and add-ons.
 
### End-to-End Declarative Lifecycle Management
Palette offers the most comprehensive profile-based management for Kubernetes, enabling teams to drive consistency, repeatability, and operational efficiency across multiple clusters in multiple environments, with comprehensive day 0 - day 2 management.
 
### Any Environment
Palette has the richest coverage in supported environments, including public clouds: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud (both IaaS and managed K8s services EKS/AKS/GKE); data center: VMware, OpenStack; Bare metal: Canonical MaaS; Edge.
 
 
 
## What is Under the Hood?
Palette uniquely extends and integrates CNCF’s open-source Cluster API project and provides comprehensive full-stack modeling and orchestration, governance, security, and day0, day1, and day2 management capabilities.
 
With Palette’s Cluster Profiles, teams can define full-stack clusters that include both the K8s infrastructure and any add-on application services. Cluster Profiles enable a repeatable way to deploy and reuse clusters across any environment. Palette also enables importing of existing Kubernetes environments and creating equivalent Cluster Profiles.

## Who Can Benefit From the Spectro Cloud Platform?
 
### Developers
 
Development teams will get the flexibility and freedom they are looking for to increase the speed of innovation, whether it is the cluster template with the add-on application services or choosing a Kubernetes version with integrations like logging, monitoring, and service mesh for your application development. They need not worry about Kubernetes configurations but focus on the stuff that matters!
 
### IT Operations and SREs
 
Declarative management makes life easier for IT teams, with consistency, repeatability, and all the enterprise-grade controls and governance they need - especially when moving to production! Cluster Profiles enable them to define and re-use full-stack clusters and support them across the entire lifecycle without having to write scripts, as well as integrate with existing tools and methodologies.
 
 
### IT Executives
 
With an open and enterprise-grade platform, IT leaders can get peace of mind without being locked into proprietary orchestration technologies or one-size-fits-all solutions. This helps lower the TCO and reduce operational risk.
