# Deploy a Cluster

Palette helps you create and manage Kubernetes clusters in various cloud environments with minimal overhead.

Palette offers profile-based management for Kubernetes, enabling consistency, repeatability, and operational efficiency across multiple clusters. A [cluster profile](/cluster-profiles) allows you to define the cluster infrastructure stack you prefer in a declarative and reusable manner. It allows you to define *customizable* infrastructure stacks using desired Operating System (OS), Kubernetes, Container Network Interfaces (CNI), Container Storage Interfaces (CSI), and additional add-on application layers. 

After defining a cluster profile, you can provide the cloud environment details, the control plane, and worker node configurations to deploy a host cluster.

This tutorial will teach you how to deploy a host cluster with Palette by using the following public cloud providers - Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You can deploy a cluster using either Palette or Terraform. You will learn about *Cluster Mode* and *Cluster Profiles* and how these components enable you to deploy applications to Kubernetes quickly with minimal effort but with high customization.

# Architecture 

As you navigate through the tutorial, use this diagram as a reference point when trying to understand how a cluster profile is used when deploying a host cluster. Palette uses the cluster profile as a blueprint when deploying the cluster. Clusters deployed by Palette have the same node pools you may be familiar with, control plane nodes, often called *master nodes* and the *worker nodes* where you will deploy applications. The result is a host cluster managed by Palette.

You can create and manage clusters directly from the Palette dashboard. Use the following steps to learn how to deploy a host cluster to multiple cloud providers.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you will need the following items

- A public cloud account from one of the following providers.
  - [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account)
  - [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-an-azure-account)
  - [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/docs/get-started)

  <br />

- Register the cloud account in Palette. Use the following resource for additional guidance.
  - [Register and Manage AWS Accounts](/clusters/public-cloud/aws/add-aws-accounts)
  - [Register and Manage Azure Cloud Accounts](/clusters/public-cloud/azure/azure-cloud)
  - [Register and Manage GCP Accounts](/clusters/public-cloud/gcp#creatingagcpcloudaccount)

  <br />

- An SSH Key Pair. Use the [Create and Upload an SSH Key](/clusters/cluster-management/ssh-keys) guide to learn how to create an SSH key and upload it to Palette.

  - AWS users must create an AWS Key pair before starting the tutorial. If you need additional guidance, check out the [Create EC2 SSH Key Pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ground-station/latest/ug/create-ec2-ssh-key-pair.html) tutorial.

## Deploy the Environment

The following steps will guide you through deploying the cluster infrastructure. You will start by creating a cluster profile and deploying the host cluster using your cluster profile.

<br />

<Tabs>
<Tabs.TabPane tab="AWS" key="aws-ui">

### Create Cluster Profile (AWS)

[Cluster profiles](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/cluster-profiles) are templates created with the following core layers.

 - Operating System (OS).
 - Kubernetes distribution.
 - Network Container Interface (CNI).
 - Storage Container Interface (CSI).
 
A cluster profile contains these core layers and additional add-on layers, such as security, monitoring, logging, etc.  

Cluster profiles enable you to create infrastructure stacks that can be customized in terms of the number of layers, type of components, and version and offer a reproducible way to create clusters.

Log in to Palette and navigate to the left **Main Menu**. Select **Profiles** to view the cluster profile page.
You can view the list of available cluster profiles. To create a cluster profile, click the **Add Cluster Profile** button at the top right.

![View of the cluster view page](/tutorials/deploy-clusters/clusters_public-cloud_deploy-k8s-cluster_profile_list_view.png)

Follow the wizard to create a new profile.

In the **Basic Information** section, assign the name **aws-profile**, a brief profile description, select the type as **Full**, and assign the tag **env:aws**. You can leave the version empty if you want to. Just be aware that the version defaults to **1.0.0**. Click on **Next**.

**Cloud Type** allows you to choose the infrastructure provider with which this cluster profile is associated. Select **AWS** and click on **Next**.

**Profile Layers**, this is the main configuration step where you specify the packs that compose the profile. There are four required infrastructure packs and several optional add-on packs you can choose from.
Every pack requires you to select the **Pack Type**, **Registry**, and **Pack Name**.

For this tutorial, use the following packs:

| Pack Name          | Version   | Layer              |
|--------------------|-----------|--------------------|
| ubuntu-aws LTS     | 20.4.x    | Operating System   |
| Kubernetes         | 1.24.x  | Kubernetes         |
| cni-calico         | 3.24.x    | Network            |
| csi-aws-ebs        | 1.16.x | Storage            |


As you fill out the information for a layer, click on **Next** to proceed to the following layer.

Click on **Confirm** after you have completed filling out all the core layers.

![A view of the cluster profile stack](/tutorials/deploy-clusters/aws/clusters_public-cloud_deploy-k8s-cluster_clusters_parameters.png)

The review section gives an overview of the cluster profile configuration you selected. Click on **Finish Configuration** to create the cluster profile. 


Cluster profiles are mutable, meaning you can modify them when you desire. You can add, remove, or edit the existing layers during modification. 

<br />


## Create a New Cluster

Navigate to the left **Main Menu** and select **Cluster**. From the clusters page, click on the **Add New Cluster** button.

## Update Cluster Profile

Once the cluster is deployed and ready you are ready for the next steps. In the following steps, you will learn how to update cluster profiles after deploying a host cluster. In this scenario, you will add a new layer to the cluster profile that contains the application.

<br />

### Add a Manifest

Navigate to the left **Main Menu** and select **Profiles**. Select the cluster profile you created earlier and applied to the host cluster.

Click on **Add Manifest** at the top of the page and fill out the following input fields. <br /> <br />

- **Layer name** - The name of the layer. Assign the name **application**.


- **Manifests**  - Add your manifest by giving it a name and clicking the **New Manifest** button. Assign a name to the internal manifest and click on the blue button  An empty editor will appear on the right side of the screen.

![Image of the blue button](/tutorials/deploy-clusters/clusters_public-cloud_deploy-k8s-cluster_manifest_blue_btn.png)

<br />

In the manifest editor, insert the following content.

<br />

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello-universe-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 8080
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: hello-universe
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello-universe-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello-universe
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello-universe
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello-universe
        image: ghcr.io/spectrocloud/hello-universe:1.0.12
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

The code snippet you added will deploy the [*hello-universe*](https://github.com/spectrocloud/hello-universe) application. You may have noticed that the code snippet you added is a Kubernetes configuration. Manifest files are a method you can use to achieve more granular customization of your Kubernetes cluster. You can add any valid Kubernetes configuration to a manifest file.

![manifest](/tutorials/deploy-clusters/clusters_public-cloud_deploy-k8s-cluster_manifest.png)

The manifest defined a replica set for the application to simulate a distributed environment with a web application deployed to Kubernetes. The application is assigned a load balancer. Using a load balancer, you can expose a single access point and distribute the workload to both containers.

Click on **Confirm & Create** to save your changes.

<br />


### Deploy

Navigate to the left **Main Menu** and select **Clusters**. Click on the host cluster you deployed to open its details page.


On the top right-hand corner is a green button **Updates Available**. Click on the button to review the available updates. Compare the new changes against the previous cluster profile definition. The only difference is the addition of a manifest that will deploy the Hello Universe application.


![Available updates details](/tutorials/deploy-clusters/deploy_app/clusters_public-cloud_deploy-k8s-cluster_update_details_compare.png)

Click on **Confirm updates** to apply the updates to the host cluster. Depending on the scope of the change this may take a few moments.

<br />


## Verify the Application

Navigate to the cluster's details page and verify you are in the **Overview** tab. Once the application is deployed and ready for network traffic, in the **Services** row, Palette will expose the service URL. Click on the URL for port **:8080** to access the Hello Universe application. 

![Deployed application](/tutorials/deploy-clusters/clusters_public-cloud_deploy-k8s-cluster_app.png)

<br />


<WarningBox>

It takes between one to three minutes for DNS to properly resolve the public load balancer URL. We recommend waiting a few moments before clicking on the service URL to prevent the browser from caching an unresolved DNS request.

##  Terraform

The [Spectro Cloud Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs) provider enables you to create and manage Palette resources in a codified manner by leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC). There are many reasons why you would want to utilize IaC. A few reasons worth highlighting are: the ability to automate infrastructure, improve collaboration related to infrastructure changes, self-document infrastructure through codification, and track all infrastructure in a single source of truth. 

If want to become more familiar with Terraform, we recommend you check out the [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro) learning resources from HashiCorp. 

<br />

## Create an API Key

Before you can get started with the Terraform code, you need a Spectro Cloud API key. 

To create an API key, log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com) and click on the user **User Menu** and select **My API Keys**. 

![Image that points to the user drop-down Menu and points to the API key link](/tutorials/deploy-clusters/clusters_public-cloud_deploy-k8s-cluster_create_api_key.png)

Next, click on **Add New API Key**. Fill out the required input field, **API Key Name**, and the **Expiration Date**. Click on **Confirm** to create the API key. Copy the key value to your clipboard, as you will use it shortly.

<br />

In your terminal session, issue the following command to export the API key as an environment variable.

<br />

```shell
export SPECTROCLOUD_APIKEY=YourAPIKeyHere
```

The [Spectro Cloud Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs) provider requires credentials to interact with the Palette API.
The Spectro Cloud Terraform provider will use the environment variable to authenticate with the Spectro Cloud API endpoint. 


## Resources Review

To help you get started with Terraform, the tutorial code is structured to support deploying a cluster to either Azure, GCP, or AWS. Before you deploy a host cluster to your target provider, take a few moments to review the following files in the folder structure.

<br />

- **providers.tf** - this file contains the Terraform providers that are used to support the deployment of the cluster.


- **inputs.tf** - a file containing all the Terraform variables for the deployment logic.


- **data.tf** - contains all the query resources that perform read actions.


- **cluster_profiles.tf** - this file contains the cluster profile definitions. Each cloud provider has its own cluster profile definition.


- **cluster.tf** - this file has all the required cluster configurations to deploy a host cluster to one of the cloud providers.


- **terraform.tfvars** - use this file to customize the deployment and target a specific cloud provider. This is the primary file you will make modifications to.


- **outputs.tf** - contains content that will be output in the terminal session upon a successful Terraform `apply` action.

In the following section, you will be able to review the core terraform resources more closely.

<br />

### Provider

The **provider.tf** file contains the Terraform providers and their respective versions. The tutorial uses two providers - the Spectro Cloud Terraform provider and the TLS Terraform provider. Take note of how the project name is specified in the `provider "spectrocloud" {}` block. You can change the target project by changing the value specified to the `project_name` parameter.

<br />


```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    spectrocloud = {
      version = ">= 0.13.1"
      source  = "spectrocloud/spectrocloud"
    }
    tls = {
      source  = "hashicorp/tls"
      version = "4.0.4"
    }
  }
}

provider "spectrocloud" {
  project_name = "Default"
}
```

The next file you should become familiar with is the **cluster-profiles.tf** file.

### Cluster Profile

The Spectro Cloud Terraform provider has several resources available for use. When creating a cluster profile, use the `spectrocloud_cluster_profile`.
This resource can be used to customize all layers of a cluster profile. You can specify all the different packs and versions to use and add a manifest or Helm chart.


In the **cluster-profiles.tf** file, the cluster profile resource is declared three times. Each instance of the resources is for a specific cloud provider. Using the AWS cluster profile as an example, notice how the cluster profile uses `pack {}` blocks to specify each layer of the cluster profile. The order you arrange the `pack {}` plays an important role, as each layer maps to the core infrastructure in a cluster profile. The first layer must be the OS, followed by Kubernetes, the container network interface, the container storage interface, etc. Ensure you define the bottom layer of the cluster profile first.

<br />

```terraform
resource "spectrocloud_cluster_profile" "aws-profile" {
  name        = "tf-aws-profile"
  description = "A basic cluster profile for AWS"
  tags        = concat(var.tags, ["env:aws"])
  cloud       = "aws"
  type        = "cluster"

  pack {
    name   = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_ubuntu.name
    tag    = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_ubuntu.version
    uid    = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_ubuntu.id
    values = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_ubuntu.values
  }

  pack {
    name   = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_k8s.name
    tag    = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_k8s.version
    uid    = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_k8s.id
    values = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_k8s.values
  }

  pack {
    name   = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_cni.name
    tag    = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_cni.version
    uid    = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_cni.id
    values = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_cni.values
  }

  pack {
    name   = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_csi.name
    tag    = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_csi.version
    uid    = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_csi.id
    values = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_csi.values
  }

  pack {
    name   = "hello-universe"
    type   = "manifest"
    tag    = "1.0.0"
    values = ""
    manifest {
      name    = "hello-universe"
      content = file("manifests/hello-universe.yaml")
    }
  }
}
```

The last `pack {}` block contains a manifest file that contains all the Kubernetes configurations for the [Hello Universe](https://github.com/spectrocloud/hello-universe) application. Including the application in the cluster profile ensures the application is installed during the cluster deployment process. If you are wondering what all the data resources are for, head on to the next section, where data resources are reviewed.


### Data Resources

You may have noticed that each `pack {}` block contains references to a data resource. 

<br />


```terraform
  pack {
    name   = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_csi.name
    tag    = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_csi.version
    uid    = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_csi.id
    values = data.spectrocloud_pack.aws_csi.values
  }
```

[Data resources](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/data-sources) are used to perform read actions in Terraform. The Spectro Cloud Terraform provider exposes several data resources to help you make your Terraform code more dynamic. The data resource used in the cluster profile is `spectrocloud_pack`. This resource enables you to query Palette for information about a specific. You can get information about the pack using the data resource, such as unique ID, registry ID, version available, and YAML values.

Below is the data resource used to query Palette for information about the Kubernetes pack for version `1.24.10`.

<br />

```terraform
data "spectrocloud_pack" "aws_k8s" {
  name    = "kubernetes"
  version = "1.24.10"
}
```

Using the data resource, you avoid manually typing in the parameter values required by the cluster profile's `pack {}` block.

### Cluster

The file **clusters.tf** contains the definitions for deploying a host cluster to one of the cloud providers. To create a host cluster, you must use one of the cluster resources specific to the cloud provider you want to target.

In this tutorial, the following Terraform cluster resources are used.

<br />

| Terraform Resource | Platform | Documentation |
|---|---|---|
| `spectrocloud_cluster_aws` | AWS | [Link](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs/resources/cluster_aws) |
| `spectrocloud_cluster_azure` | Azure | [Link](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs/resources/cluster_azure)|
| `spectrocloud_cluster_gcp` | GCP |  [Link](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs/resources/cluster_gcp)|


Using the `spectrocloud_cluster_azure` resource used in the tutorial as an example, notice how the resource accepts a set of parameters.When deploying a cluster, you can change the same parameters through the Palette User Interface (UI). You can learn more about each parameter by reviewing the resource's documentation page hosted in the Terraform registry.

<br />

```terraform
resource "spectrocloud_cluster_azure" "cluster" {
  name             = "azure-cluster"
  tags             = concat(var.tags, ["env:azure"])
  cloud_account_id = data.spectrocloud_cloudaccount_azure.account[0].id

  cloud_config {
    subscription_id = var.azure_subscription_id
    resource_group  = var.azure_resource_group
    region          = var.azure-region
    ssh_key         = tls_private_key.tutorial_ssh_key[0].public_key_openssh
  }

  cluster_profile {
    id = spectrocloud_cluster_profile.azure-profile[0].id
  }

  machine_pool {
    control_plane           = true
    control_plane_as_worker = true
    name                    = "master-pool"
    count                   = var.azure_master_nodes.count
    instance_type           = var.azure_master_nodes.instance_type
    azs                     = var.azure_master_nodes.azs
    is_system_node_pool     = var.azure_master_nodes.is_system_node_pool
    disk {
      size_gb = var.azure_master_nodes.disk_size_gb
      type    = "Standard_LRS"
    }
  }

  machine_pool {
    name                = "worker-basic"
    count               = var.azure_worker_nodes.count
    instance_type       = var.azure_worker_nodes.instance_type
    azs                 = var.azure_worker_nodes.azs
    is_system_node_pool = var.azure_worker_nodes.is_system_node_pool
  }

  timeouts {
    create = "30m"
    delete = "15m"
  }
}
```
## Deploy Cluster

You must first make changes to the **terraform.tfvars** file. Open the **terraform.tfvars** file in any editor of your choice, and focus on the cloud provider you want to deploy a host cluster.

In this Terraform template, to help simplify things, we have added a toggle variable that you can use to select the deployment environment. Each cloud provider has its section containing all the variables you must populate. If a variable under your chosen cloud provider has the value `REPLACE_ME`, it must be replaced.

As an example, review the AWS section. To deploy to AWS, you would change `deploy-aws = false` to `deploy-aws = true`. Additionally, you would replace all the variables with a value `REPLACE_ME`. You can also change the nodes in either the master pool or worker pool by updating the values.

```terraform
###########################
# AWS Deployment Settings
############################
deploy-aws = false # Set to true to deploy to AWS

aws-cloud-account-name = "REPLACE_ME"
aws-region             = "REPLACE_ME"
aws-key-pair-name      = "REPLACE_ME"

aws_master_nodes = {
  count              = "1"
  control_plane      = true
  instance_type      = "m4.2xlarge"
  disk_size_gb       = "60"
  availability_zones = ["REPLACE_ME"] # If you want to deploy to multiple AZs, add them here
}

aws_worker_nodes = {
  count              = "1"
  control_plane      = false
  instance_type      = "m4.2xlarge"
  disk_size_gb       = "60"
  availability_zones = ["REPLACE_ME"] # If you want to deploy to multiple AZs, add them here
}
```

After you have made all the required changes, issue the following command to initialize Terraform.

<br />

```shell
terraform init
```

Next, issue the plan command to preview the changes.

<br />

```shell
terraform plan
```


Output:
```shell
Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

If you change the desired cloud provider's toggle variable to `true,` you will receive an output stating two new resources will be created. The two resources are your cluster profile and the host cluster.

To deploy all the resources, use the apply command.

<br />

```shell
terraform apply -auto-approve
```


### Verify the Profile


To check out the cluster profile creation in Palette, login to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com), and from the left **Main Menu** click on **Profiles** to access the profile page. Scan the list and look for a cluster profile with the following name pattern `tf-[cloud provier]-profile`. Click on the cluster profile to review its details, such as layers, packs, and versions.

  <br />

While you wait for the cluster deployment process to complete, feel free to check out a video where we discuss the growing pains of using Kubernetes and how Palette can help your address these pain points.

<br />


<YouTube url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wM3hcrHbAC0" title="Three Common Kubernetes Growing Pains  - and how to solve them" />

<br />

## Validate

Once the cluster is deployed and ready, you can access the deployed application Hello Universe.
From the cluster's **Overview** page, click on the URL for port **:8080** next to the **hello-universe-service** in the **Services** row. This URL will take you to the application landing page. 

<br />


<WarningBox>

It takes between one to three minutes for DNS to properly resolve the public load balancer URL. We recommend waiting a few moments before clicking on the service URL to prevent the browser from caching an unresolved DNS request.

Welcome to Hello Universe, a demo application to help you learn more about Palette and its features. Feel free to click on the logo to increase the counter and for a fun image change.

You have deployed your first application to a cluster managed by Palette through Terraform. Your first application is a single container application with no upstream dependencies.


## Cleanup

Use the following steps to clean up all the resources you created for the tutorial. Use the destroy command to remove all the resources you created through Terraform.

<br />

```shell
terraform destroy --auto-approve
```

Output:
```shell
Destroy complete! Resources: 2 destroyed.
```

<br />

<InfoBox>

If a cluster remains in the delete phase for over 15 minutes, it becomes eligible for Force Delete. To trigger a force delete, navigate to the respective cluster’s details page and click on Settings. Click on the Force Delete Cluster to delete the cluster. Palette will automatically remove clusters stuck in the cluster deletion phase for over 24 hours.

</InfoBox>


If you are using the tutorial container and want to exit the container, type `exit` in your terminal session and press the **Enter** key. Next, issue the following command to stop the container.

<br />

```shell

# Wrap-up

In this tutorial, you created a cluster profile, which is a template containing the core layers required to deploy a host cluster. You then deployed a host cluster onto your preferred cloud service provider. Once the cluster deployed, you updated the cluster profile and added the application Hello Universe to the profile definition, and applied the updates to the host cluster.

Palette assures consistency across cluster deployments through cluster profiles. Palette also enables you to quickly deploy applications to a Kubernetes environment with little or no prior Kubernetes knowledge. In a matter of minutes, you were able to provision a new Kubernetes cluster and deploy an application.

We encourage you to check out the [Deploy an Application using Palette Dev Engine](/devx/apps/deploy-app) tutorial to learn more about Palette. Palette Dev Engine can help you deploy applications more quickly through the usage of [virtual clusters](/glossary-all#palettevirtualcluster).
