  # Integrations
  Integrations are the additional entities that are used to ensure and/or improve on the functionality of Kubernetes. Integrations are better understood as the options that are available for the various "layers" of the Spectro Cloud SaaS.

  # Layers
  Kubernetes, as the official document [says](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/#what-kubernetes-is-not), is "not a traditional, all-inclusive PaaS system". As such, it requires a lot of [add-ons](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#addons) tailored for specific uses. ([A full list of add-ons is available here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/)). The specific uses (or the functionalities) that the add-ons provide are called "Layers" in the Spectro Cloud universe. For example, authentication is a layer that has the options of Dex and Permission Manager. Monitoring is another layer with options of Kubernetes Dashboard, Prometheus Grafana, and a whole lot more. To learn more about individual integrations, use the search bar below to find a specific option. Alternatively, use the filter buttons to see the available options.
