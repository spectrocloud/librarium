# Overview
Palette provides packs that are tailored for specific uses to support the core infrastructure a cluster needs and add-on packs to extend Kubernetes functionality. Each pack you add to a cluster profile is considered a layer in the profile.  

When you create a cluster profile, you choose the type of pack you want to add: **Full**, **Infrastructure**, or **Add-on**. **Full** refers to the combination of **Infrastructure** and **Add-on** packs. Add-on packs can be stand-alone or integrated. Refer to [Stand-alone and Integrated Packs](/standalone-integrated-packs) for more information.

When you choose **Infrastructure** or **Add-on**, Palette presents only packs that provide functionality for the selected pack type. When you choose **Full**, Palette presents all the packs so you can build your cluster profile from the base layer up. To learn more about cluster profiles, check out the [Cluster Profiles](/cluster-profiles) guide.     

To learn more about individual packs, use the search bar below to find a specific option. Alternatively, use the filter buttons to display available options.
