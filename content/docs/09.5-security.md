# Overview

We view security as more than a feature. It is a fundamental aspect of our business and culture through transparency, continuous learning, and a security-first mindset. 

By instilling a sense of collective responsibility for security, everyone at Spectro Cloud contributes to our overall security posture. Our dedication to security helps protect your interests and enhances the quality and reliability of our software and services.

<br />

## Security Culture and Awareness

All employees at Spectro Cloud receive mandatory security training. Developers receive additonal training focused on software security, as they are the first line of defense through secure coding practices. Our developers complete Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10 training to understand, identify and mitigate the most critical security risks and vulnerabilities to web applications.

## Product Security

Paletteâ€™s robust security measures safeguard your data and ensure the integrity of our services. We adhere to industry-leading standards and continuously refine our practices to provide the highest level of security. Palette infrastructure safeguards data in your Kubernetes production environment with its zero-trust architecture, granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), read-only Linux distributions, and hardened clusters and Kubernetes packs. Review [Infrastructure Security](/security/infrastructure) to learn more.   

Palette's security controls ensure data protection in SaaS operation at the management platform level and the tenant cluster level. To learn more, refer to [SaaS Operation](/security/saas-operation). In self-hosted operation, where Palette is typically deployed on-prem behind a firewall, you must ensure security controls in your environment. Find out more about on-prem deployment in [Self-Hosted Operation](/security/self-hosted-operation).

<br />

## Transparency

We list any Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) issues that affect Palette or any part of its infrastructure in our [Security Bulletins](/security/security-bulletins) along with the fix applied.
