# Overview

Paletteâ€™s robust security measures safeguard your data and ensure the integrity of our services. We adhere to industry-leading standards and continuously refine  our practices to provide the highest level of security. Palette safeguards data in your Kubernetes production environment with its zero-trust architecture, granular role-based access control (RBAC), read-only Linux distributions, and hardened clusters and Kubernetes packs. 

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) issues that affect Palette or any part of its infrastructure are listed in our [Security Bulletins](/security/security-bulletins) along with the fix applied.

Palette's security controls ensure data protection in SaaS operation at the management platform level and the tenant cluster level. In self-hosted operation, where Palette is typically deployed on-prem behind a firewall, you must ensure security controls in your environment. Find out more about on-prem deployment in [Self-Hosted Operation](/security/self-hosted-operation).
