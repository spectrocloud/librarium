# Packs


A Pack is a collection of files such as Manifests, Helm charts, Ansible roles, Configuration files, etc. It is the building block of a cluster profile to create layers such as operating systems, Kubernetes, network, storage, and add-ons.  Ansible roles, if provided, are used to customize cluster VM images whereas Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts are applied to the Kubernetes clusters after deployment.

## Structure

Palette provides a rich collection of out-of-the-box packs for various integrations and also offers extensibility through custom-built packs. The following is a typical structure of a pack:


| **Pack Name** |**Requirement** | **Pack Directory Name** |
|-|-|-|
| pack.json | mandatory| pack config|
| values.yaml| mandatory| pack params + values.yaml from charts <br /> + templated params from ansible-roles + all config from manifests|
| logo.png| optional| pack logo|
| manifests| optional| manifest files for the pack|
| ansible-roles| optional| ansible-roles used to install the pack|
| charts| optional| charts to be deployed for the pack|

# Registries


The pack registry is a server-side application to store and serve packs to its clients. Packs from a pack registry are retrieved and presented as options during the creation of a cluster profile. Palette supports the configuration of multiple registries.

## Default Registry

The default pack registry is Spectro Cloud's public pack registry. It consists of several packs that make it easy for a user to quickly create a cluster profile and launch a Kubernetes cluster with their choice of integrations. Palette maintains all packs in this pack registry and takes care of upgrading packs in the pack registry whenever required.

## Custom Pack Registry

Users can set up a custom pack registry using a Docker image provided by Spectro Cloud to upload and maintain custom packs. Spectro Cloud provides a CLI tool to interact with and manage pack content in the pack registry. Custom registries offer a mechanism of extending the capabilities of a platform by defining additional integrations.

# Spectro CLI



Spectro Cloud CLI is a Command Line Interface to interact with the Spectro Cloud Pack Registry server for uploads and downloads of packs. CLI must authenticate with the pack registry before executing any CLI command.

## Downloads
