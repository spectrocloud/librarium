# Overview

Our comprehensive approach to security is ingrained in each stage of our development lifecycle. From initial design and coding to testing and deployment, our processes are designed to identify, prevent, and mitigate security risks to ensure we deliver reliable and secure solutions for you. 

Our Security team reviews early in the design process and identifies real and potential issues, which are logged in a ticketing system. Closer to release we conduct more reviews, and automated scans for common vulnerabilities are completed. Scans go beyond our own code to  include third-party libraries and container images. Should any vulnerabilities be found, we block the release until it our Security team approves it. At that time, we apply remediations.
