### September 01, 2023 - CVE-2023-29404 - Vulnerability Security Advisory - 9.8 CVSS

<br />

### Description

The `go` command can execute any code during the build process when using cgo. This can happen when using `go get` command on a malicious module or any other command that builds untrusted code. It can also be triggered by linker flags specified through the `#cgo LDFLAGS` directive. The non-optional flags in LDFLAGS sanitization allow disallowed flags to be used with gc and gccgo compilers.

<br />

### Impact

No impact. This is not a runtime issue and we do not compile untrusted code.

<br />

### Affected Products

Not applicable.

<br />

### Resolution/Patches

Not applicable.

<br />

### Workarounds

Not applicable.

### September 01, 2023 CVE-2023-29402 - Vulnerability Security Advisory - 9.8 CVSS

<br />

### Description

The go command may generate unexpected code at build time when using cgo. Using unexpected code with cgo can cause unexpected behavior in Go programs. This may occur when an untrusted module contains directories with newline characters in their names. Go modules retrieved using the command `go get` are unaffected. Modules retrieved using the legacy module retrieve method with the environment variable `GOPATH` and `GO111MODULE=off` may be affected.

<br />

### Impact

No impact. This is not a runtime issue and we do not compile untrusted code.

<br />

### Affected Products

### September 01, 2023 - CVE-2023-29402 - Vulnerability Security Advisory - 9.8 CVSS


### Description:

The go command may execute arbitrary code at build time when using cgo. The arbitrary code execution may occur when the command `go get` is issued on a malicious module or when using any other command that builds untrusted code. This can be triggered by linker flags specified via a `#cgo LDFLAGS directive`. Flags containing embedded spaces are mishandled, and disallowed flags are smuggled through the LDFLAGS sanitization by including them in the argument of another flag. This only affects the gccgo compiler.

<br />

### Impact

No impact. This is not a runtime issue and we do not compile untrusted code.

<br />

### Affected Products

Not applicable.

<br />

### Resolution/Patches

Not applicable.

<br />

### Workarounds

### September 01, 2023 - CVE-2023-24540 - HTML Template Security Advisory - 9.8 CVSS

<br />

### Description


Not all valid JavaScript whitespace characters are considered to be whitespace. JavaScript templates containing whitespace characters outside of the character set `\t\n\f\r\u0020\u2028\u2029` may not be properly sanitized during execution.

<br />

### Impact

No impact - We use the Go package [html/template](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template) but our HTML templates are static. We also do not accept or parse any provided user data.

<br />

### Affected Products

Not applicable.

<br />

### Resolution/Patches

Not applicable.

### Workarounds

Not applicable.

## March 20, 2023 - CVE-2023-22809 Sudo Vulnerability in Palette - 7.8 CVSS

A security vulnerability in `sudo -e` option (aka *sudoedit*) allows a malicious user with sudoedit privileges to edit arbitrary files. The Palette container `palette-controller-manager:mold-manager` incorporates a sudo version affected by sudoers policy bypass in sudo when using sudoedit.

All versions of Palette before  v2.6.70 are affected.

<br />

#### Impact

A local user with permission to edit files can use this flaw to change a file not permitted by the security policy, resulting in privilege escalation.

<br />

#### Resolution

* For Palette SaaS, this has been addressed and requires no user action. 
* For ​​Palette self-hosted deployments, please upgrade to newer versions greater than or equal to  v2.6.70 to address the reported vulnerability.
  
<br />

#### Workarounds

None.

## August 4, 2022 - CVE-2022-1292 c_rehash script vulnerability in vSphere CSI pack - 9.8 CVSS

On May 3 2022, OpenSSL published a security advisory disclosing a command injection vulnerability in the `c_rehash` script included with the OpenSSL library. Some operating systems automatically execute this script as a part of normal operations, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.

Palette is not directly affected by this vulnerability. However, if your cluster profile is using the vSphere CSI pack, version v2.3 or below, it contains a vulnerable version of the `c_rehash` script.


<br />

#### Impact

The `c_rehash` script does not sanitize shell metacharacters properly to prevent command injection. This script is distributed by some operating systems, and by extension, in container images, in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script.

<br />

#### Resolution

This vulnerability has been addressed in the vSphere CSI pack greater than or equal to version v2.6.

<br />

#### Workarounds

Update cluster profiles using the vSphere CSI pack to version v2.6 or greater. Apply the updated cluster profile changes to all clusters consuming the cluster profile.
