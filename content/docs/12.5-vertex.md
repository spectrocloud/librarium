# Overview

Palette VerteX offers regulated industries such as government and public sector organizations simplicity, security, and scale in production Kubernetes. This self-hosted installation offering requires a private Open Virtualization Format (OVF) installer.

Palette VerteX integrates validated Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 cryptographic modules with Palette and the Kubernetes clusters it deploys to ensure strong data protection for your organization’s infrastructure and applications. To learn more about our FIPS 140-2 certification, review [Spectro Cloud Cryptographic Module](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/4349). FIPS modules extend Palette’s existing security features that include security scans, powerful RBAC, and tamper-proof edge device images. Palette VerteX protects sensitive data in clusters across edge, bare metal, on-prem data centers, air-gapped environments, and cloud. 

With its additional security scanning capabilities, FIPS-enabled Palette VerteX is designed to meet the stringent requirements of regulated industries. VerteX runs on FIPS-enabled Ubuntu versions 20.0.x and 22.0.x and is self-hosted in your cloud and in air-gapped environments. A VMware installer is available to simplify the deployment process. You can also install Palette VerteX using a Helm chart. The required FIPS module is accessible in our private artifact repository.
