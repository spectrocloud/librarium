- An existing VM with an OS of Rocky Linux 8 or 9 installed. This VM will be used as the base of your image and must
  meet the following requirements:

  - The following tools installed:

    - [conntrack-tools](https://conntrack-tools.netfilter.org/)
    - [cloud-init](https://cloud-init.io/)
    - [cloud-utils-growpart](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-utils/)
    - [iptables](https://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables)
    - python2-pip
    - [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

  - A user of `builder` with a password of `builder`. This is required by the
    [vsphere-clone-builder](https://image-builder.sigs.k8s.io/capi/providers/vsphere#vsphere-clone-builder). The
    `builder` user must be granted passwordless sudo privileges.

    <details>

    <summary> `builder` user and password privileges </summary>

            1. On your Rocky Linux VM, add a `builder` user.

                ```shell
                sudo useradd builder
                ```

            2. Set the password for the `builder` user to `builder`.

                ```shell
                echo 'builder:builder' | sudo chpasswd
                ```

            3. Assign passwordless sudo privileges to the `builder` user and assign the appropriate permissions.

                ```shell
                echo 'builder ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL' | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/builder
                sudo chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/builder
                ```

    </details>

  - SSH password authentication enabled in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` by setting `PasswordAuthentication` to `yes`. You must
    either restart `sshd` or reboot your system for the changes to take effect.

  - SSH password authentication enabled for `cloud-init` by setting `ssh_pwauth` to `true`. This is required to prevent
    `cloud-init` from overwriting `PasswordAuthentication yes` in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` when booting the cloned VM. We
    recommend creating a separate file that explicitly sets `ssh_pwauth: true`.

        ```shell
        sudo tee /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-enable-ssh-pwauth.cfg << EOF
        ssh_pwauth: true
        EOF
        ```

  - [IPv4 packet forwarding](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/#prerequisite-ipv4-forwarding-optional)
    enabled.

  - firewalld disabled.

        <details>

            <summary> Check firewalld status </summary>

              1. Check the status of `firewalld`. Note the `Active` status.

                 ```shell
                 systemctl status firewalld
                 ```

                 ```shell title="Example output" hideClipboard {3}
                 ● firewalld.service - firewalld - dynamic firewall daemon

                         Tasks: 2 (limit: 100604)
                     Memory: 45.3M
                     CGroup: /system.slice/firewalld.service

                 ```

              2. If you have a status of `Active: active`, disable `firewalld`.

                 ```shell
                 sudo systemctl disable --now firewalld
                 ```

                 ```shell title="Example output" hideClipboard
                 Removed /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/firewalld.service.
                 Removed /etc/systemd/system/dbus-org.fedoraproject.FirewallD1.service.
                 ```

              3. Confirm `firewalld` has a status of `Active: inactive`.

                 ```shell
                 systemctl status firewalld
                 ```

                 ```shell title="Example output" hideClipboard {3}

                     Active: inactive (dead)

  - `/tmp` mounted to execute binaries and scripts.

          <details>
          <summary> Check `/tmp` status </summary>

          1. Check the mount status of `/tmp`. Look for a status of `noexec`.

              ```shell
              mount | grep '/tmp'
              ```

              ```shell title="Example output" hideClipboard
              tmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=2G)
              ```

              :::tip

              If you receive an error, where `/tmp` is not displayed in the mount output, it is likely because it is a regular directory on the filesystem and not a separate mount.

              Issue the following command to confirm the mount point of `/tmp`. If the `Mounted on` location is `/`, no action is required.

              ```shell
              df --human-readable /tmp
              ```

              ```shell title="Example output" hideClipboard
              Filesystem           Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
              /dev/mapper/rl-root   70G  3.7G   67G   6% /
              ```

              :::

          2. If `/tmp` has a status of `noexec`, use your preferred text editor to edit the file `/etc/fstab` and set `/tmp` to `exec`.

              ```shell
              vi /etc/fstab
              ```

              ```shell title="Example output" hideClipboard {9}

              ```

          3. Remount all filesystems in `/etc/fstab`.

              ```shell
              sudo mount --all
              ```

          4. Confirm the mount status of `/tmp` is set to `exec`.

              ```shell
              mount | grep '/tmp'
              ```

              ```shell title="Example output" hideClipboard
              tmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,exec,relatime,size=2G)
              ```

  - If your system has been hardened using a Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) policy, you may need to
    remediate the following:

            - SELinux may prevent binaries from executing, including `cloud-init` scripts. We recommend setting the SELinux
              status to `permissive` or `disabled` until the image building process is complete.

              <details>

              <summary> Check SELinux status </summary>

                1.  Check the status of SELinux.

                    ```shell
                    getenforce
                    ```

                    ```shell title="Example output" hideClipboard
                    Enforcing
                    ```

                2.  If the status is `Enforcing`, use your preferred text editor to open the SELinux config file and set `SELINUX`
                    to either `permissive` or `disabled`.

                        ```shell
                        vi /etc/selinux/config
                        ```

                        ```shell title="Example output" hideClipboard {6}
                        # This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
                        # SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
                        #     enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
                        #     permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
                        #     disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
                        SELINUX=permissive
                        # SELINUXTYPE= can take one of these three values:
                        #     targeted - Targeted processes are protected,
                        #     minimum - Modification of targeted policy. Only selected processes are protected.
                        #     mls - Multi Level Security protection.
                        SELINUXTYPE=targeted
                    ```

    - fapolicyd may prevent certain applications from executing, such as `containerd-shim-runc-v2`. We recommend
      disabling `fapolicyd` until the image building process is complete.

            <details>

            <summary> Check fapolicyd status </summary>

              1. Check the status of `fapolicyd`. Note the `Active` status.

                 ```shell

              3. Confirm `fapolicyd` has a status of `Active: inactive`.

                 ```shell
                 systemctl status firewalld
                 ```
