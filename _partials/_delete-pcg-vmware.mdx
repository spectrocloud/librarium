After deleting your VMware cluster and cluster profile, proceed with the PCG deletion. Log in to Palette as a tenant
admin, navigate to the left **Main Menu** and select **Tenant Settings**. Next, from the **Tenant Settings Menu**, click
on **Private Cloud Gateways**. Identify the PCG you want to delete, click on the **Three-Dot Menu** at the end of the
PCG row, and select **Delete**. Click **OK** to confirm the PCG deletion.

Palette will delete the PCG and the Palette services deployed on the PCG node. However, the underlying infrastructure
resources, such as the virtual machine, must be removed manually from VMware vSphere.

Log in to your VMware vSphere server and select the VM representing the PCG node named `gateway-tutorial-cp`. Click on
the **Three-Dot Actions** button, select **Power**, and **Power Off** to power off the machine. Once the machine is
powered off, click on the **Three-Dot Actions** button again and select **Delete from Disk** to remove the machine from
your VMware vSphere environment.
