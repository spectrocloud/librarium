Palette Virtual Machine Orchestrator (VMO) provides a unified platform for deploying, managing, and scaling Virtual
Machines (VMs) and containerized applications within Kubernetes clusters. Palette VMO supports deployment to edge
devices and bare metal servers in data centers.

Palette VMO simplifies infrastructure management, improves resource utilization, and eliminates hypervisor costs.

## Use Cases

You will benefit from Palette VMO in the following cases:

- You are planning to gradually shift from VMs to containers and want to continue using both during the transition.

- Your established infrastructure combines containers and VMs, and you want to manage them more effectively.

- You are integrating new VM-based applications into an existing containerized infrastructure.

- You are managing edge locations with VM-based workloads and would like to stop using a hypervisor.
