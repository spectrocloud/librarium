  - 8 CPU cores
  - 32 GB RAM
  - 250 GB storage
  - The worker node machine must have two disks.

- Three routable, static IP addresses available in your MAAS environment's network.

- An existing <VersionedLink text="MAAS Private Cloud Gateway (PCG)" url="/clusters/pcg/deploy-pcg/maas"/> in your MAAS environment.

- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) installed locally.

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation) installed if you choose to follow along using the tutorial container. Check out [this guide](https://github.com/spectrocloud/tutorials/blob/main/docs/docker.md) to learn how to use the container instead of your local machine.
