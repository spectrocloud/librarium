If a cluster remains in the delete phase for over 15 minutes, it becomes eligible for a forced delete. To trigger a
forced delete, navigate to the clusterâ€™s overview page, select **Settings** > **Force Delete Cluster**.
Palette automatically removes clusters stuck in the cluster deletion phase for over 24 hours.

If a force delete is required, ensure you use the MAAS console to release the resources you used for this tutorial manually.
