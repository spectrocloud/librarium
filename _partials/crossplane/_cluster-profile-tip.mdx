If you want to use different packs in your cluster profile, use the Palette UI to simulate creating a cluster
profile to gather the pack's required values. During the cluster profile creation, select the **API** button in the
top-right to display the API payload. Replace the values of each pack's `name`, `tag`, `uid`, `registryUid`, and
`values` as necessary. For information on creating cluster profiles, refer to our 
<VersionedLink text="Create Cluster Profiles" url="/profiles/cluster-profiles/create-cluster-profiles" /> guide.
