Once the Palette Crossplane provider is installed and set up, create a file to store the
<VersionedLink text="cluster profile" url="/profiles/cluster-profiles" /> configuration.

:::warning

We recommend creating the cluster profile file first and directly pasting the contents into the file. Redirecting
cluster profile configurations from the terminal into the file can misinterpret escape characters, resulting in an
invalid file.
