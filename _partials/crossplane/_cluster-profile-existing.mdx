1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com/). Ensure you log in as the tenant under which you
will deploy your cluster, and select the appropriate project.

2. From the left main menu, select **Clusters**.

3. Select the cluster profile to use.

4. From the browser address bar, copy the cluster profile URL, and set it as a variable.

    ```shell
    URL=<cluster-profile-URL>
    ```

    ```shell hideClipboard title="Example URL"
    URL=https://console.spectrocloud.com/projects/6342eab2faa0813ead9082e0/profiles/cluster/689a4460ab5cs617a5afa29a
    ```

5. Use the cluster profile URL to fetch the value of your cluster profile ID and set it as a variable. 

    ```shell
    CLUSTER_PROFILE_ID="$(basename "${URL%/}")"
    echo Cluster Profile ID: $CLUSTER_PROFILE_ID
    ```

    ```shell hideClipboard title="Example output"
    Cluster Profile ID: 689a4460ab5cs617a5afa29a
    ```
