1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com/). Ensure you log in as the correct tenant under which you
will deploy your cluster, and select the appropriate project.

2. From the left main menu, select **Clusters**.

3. Select the cluster profile to use.

4. In the browser address bar, copy the cluster profile ID. The profile ID is the last string in the address, which
consists of 24 alphanumeric characters.

    For example, if the full link to the cluster profile ID is
    `https://console.spectrocloud.com/projects/6342eab2faa0813ead9082e0/profiles/cluster/689a4460ab5cs617a5afa29a`,
    the ID is `689a4460ab5cs617a5afa29a`.

5. Set the cluster profile ID as a variable. Replace `<cluster-profile-id>` with the value of your ID.

    ```shell
    CLUSTER_PROFILE_ID=<cluster-profile-id>
    ```
