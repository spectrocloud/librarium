Clusters deployed in <VersionedLink text="Azure Government Secret" url="/clusters/public-cloud/azure/azure-cloud" /> cloud must
reference the appropriate Spectro Cloud Azure Government Secret Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) image in the OS layer of your
<VersionedLink text="cluster profile" url="/profiles/cluster-profiles" />. These images must be uploaded to your 
private registry, and the `<os-name-and-version>` and `<kubernetes-version>` referenced in the VHD image must match the OS
and Kubernetes layers specified in your cluster profile. Only certain OS and Kubernetes combinations are supported.
Contact your customer support representative for details.
