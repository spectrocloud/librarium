- Clusters deployed in Azure Government Secret cloud must 
use <VersionedLink text="Azure Disk CSI Driver" url="/integrations/packs/?pack=csi-azure" /> version 1.31.2-rev2 for the 
storage layer in your [cluster profile](/profiles/cluster-profiles).

- Clusters deployed in Azure Government Secret cloud must
reference the appropriate Spectro Cloud Azure Government Secret Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) image in the OS layer of your
[cluster profile](/profiles/cluster-profiles). These images must be uploaded to your 
private registry, and the `<os-name-and-version>` and `<kubernetes-version>` referenced in the VHD image must match the OS
and Kubernetes layers specified in your cluster profile. Only certain OS and Kubernetes combinations are supported.
