### Support Lifecycle

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
We support CNCF Kubernetes for N-3 Kubernetes minor versions for a duration of 14 months. The duration exceeds the
official EOL by four months. Once we stop supporting the minor version, we initiate the deprecation process. Refer to
the <VersionedLink text="Kubernetes Support Lifecycle" url="//integrations/kubernetes-support" /> guide to learn more.



:::warning

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
Once you upgrade your cluster to a new Kubernetes version, you will not be able to downgrade. We recommend that, before
upgrading, you review the information provided in the <VersionedLink text="Kubernetes Upgrades" url="/integrations/packs/?pack=edge-native-byoi" />
section.

Review the <VersionedLink text="Maintenance Policy" url="/integrations/maintenance-policy/" /> to learn about pack update and deprecation schedules.

<TabItem label="1.29.x" value="1.29">


The Kubeadm configuration file is where you can do the following:

- Change the default `podCIDR` and `serviceClusterIpRange` values. CIDR IPs specified in the configuration file take
  precedence over other defined CIDR IPs in your environment.

  As you build your cluster, check that the `podCIDR` value does not overlap with any hosts or with the service network
  and the `serviceClusterIpRange` value does not overlap with any IP ranges assigned to nodes or pods. 

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- Change the default cluster DNS service domain from `cluster.local` to a DNS domain that you specify. You can only
  change the DNS domain during cluster creation. For more information, refer to
  <VersionedLink text="Change Cluster DNS Service Domain" url="/integrations/packs/?pack=kubernetes-eks#change-cluster-dns-service-domain" />.
  

- Add a certificate for the Spectro Proxy pack if you want to use a reverse proxy with a Kubernetes cluster. For more
  information, refer to the <VersionedLink text="Spectro Proxy" url="/integrations/packs/?pack=spectro-proxy" /> guide.

### Change Cluster DNS Service Domain

The `pack.serviceDomain` parameter with default value `cluster.local` is not visible in the Kubernetes YAML file, and
its value can only be changed at cluster creation. To change the value, you must add `serviceDomain: "cluster.local"` to
the Kubernetes YAML file when you create a cluster, and specify the service domain you want to use.

```yaml hideClipboard
pack:
  k8sHardening: True
  podCIDR: "172.16.0.0/16"
  serviceClusterIPRange: "10.96.0.0/12"
  serviceDomain: "<your_cluster_DNS_service_domain>"
```

:::warning

You can specify the service domain only at cluster creation. After the cluster creation completes, you cannot update the
value. Attempting to update it results in the error `serviceDomain update is forbidden for existing cluster`.

:::

For more information about networking configuration with DNS domains, refer to the Kubernetes
[Networking](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kubeadm-config.v1beta3/#kubeadm-k8s-io-v1beta3-Networking)
API documentation.

### Configuration Changes

The Kubeadm config is updated with hardening improvements that do the following:

- Meet CIS standards for Operating Systems (OS).

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- Enable a Kubernetes audit policy in the pack. The audit policy is hidden, and you cannot customize the default audit
  policy. If you want to apply your custom audit policy, refer to the
  <VersionedLink text="Enable Audit Logging" url="/audit-logs/kube-api-audit-logging/" /> guide to learn how to create your custom audit policy
  by adjusting the API server flags.

- Replace a deprecated PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) with one that offers three built-in policy profiles for broad security
  coverage:

  - **Privileged**: An unrestricted policy that provides wide permission levels and allows for known privilege
    escalations.

  - **Baseline**: A policy that offers minimal restrictions and prevents known privilege escalations. As shown in the
    example below, you can override the default cluster-wide policy to set baseline enforcement by enabling the
    `PodSecurity` Admission plugin in the `enable-admission-plugins` section of the YAML file. You can then add a custom
    Admission configuration and set the `admission-control-config-file` flag to the custom Admission.

    ```yaml
    kubeadmconfig:
    apiServer:
      extraArgs:
        secure-port: "6443"
        anonymous-auth: "true"
        profiling: "false"
        disable-admission-plugins: "AlwaysAdmit"
        default-not-ready-toleration-seconds: "60"
        default-unreachable-toleration-seconds: "60"
        enable-admission-plugins: "AlwaysPullImages,NamespaceLifecycle,ServiceAccount,NodeRestriction,PodSecurity"
        admission-control-config-file: "/etc/kubernetes/pod-security-standard.yaml"
        audit-log-path: /var/log/apiserver/audit.log
        audit-policy-file: /etc/kubernetes/audit-policy.yaml
    ```

  - **Restricted**: A heavily restricted policy that follows the best practices of Pod hardening. This policy is set to
    warn and audit and identifies Pods that require privileged access.

    You can enforce these policies at the Cluster or Namespace level. For workloads that require privileged access, you
    can relax `PodSecurity` enforcement by adding these labels in the Namespace:

    ```yaml
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: privileged
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version: v1.26
    ```

### Kubeadm Configuration File

The default pack YAML contains minimal configurations offered by the managed provider.

### Configure OIDC Identity Provider

You can configure an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider to authenticate users and groups in your cluster. OIDC is
an authentication layer on top of OAuth 2.0, an authorization framework that allows users to authenticate to a cluster
without using a password.

OIDC requires a _Role Binding_ for the users or groups you want to provide cluster access. You must create a Role
Binding to a Kubernetes role that is available in the cluster. The Kubernetes role can be a custom role you created or a
[default Kubernetes role](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#user-facing-roles), such as the
`cluster-admin` role. To learn how to create a Role Binding through Palette, refer to
<VersionedLink text="Create Role Bindings" url="/clusters/cluster-management/cluster-rbac/#create-role-bindings" />.

#### Configure Custom OIDC

The custom method to configure OIDC and apply RBAC for an OIDC provider can be used for all cloud services except Amazon
Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and Azure AKS.

<Tabs queryString="oidc-mode">

<TabItem label="Custom OIDC Setup" value="Custom OIDC Setup">

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
Follow these steps to configure a third-party OIDC IDP. You can apply these steps to all the public cloud providers
except Azure AKS and Amazon EKS clusters. Azure AKS and Amazon EKS require different configurations. AKS requires you to
use Azure Active Directory (AAD) to enable OIDC integration. Refer to <VersionedLink text="Enable OIDC in Kubernetes Clusters With Entra ID" url="/user-management/saml-sso/palette-sso-with-entra-id/#enable-oidc-in-kubernetes-clusters-with-entra-id" />
to learn more. Click the **Amazon EKS** tab for steps to configure OIDC for EKS clusters.

1. Add the following parameters to your Kubernetes YAML file when creating a cluster profile. Replace the
   `identityProvider` value with your OIDC provider name.

   ```yaml
   pack:
     palette:
       config:
         oidc:
           identityProvider: yourIdentityProviderNameHere
   ```

2. Add the following `kubeadmconfig` parameters. Replace the values with your OIDC provider values.

   ```yaml
   kubeadmconfig:
     apiServer:
       extraArgs:
         oidc-issuer-url: "provider URL"
         oidc-client-id: "client-id"
         oidc-groups-claim: "groups"
         oidc-username-claim: "email"
   ```

3. Under the `clientConfig` parameter section of Kubernetes YAML file, uncomment the `oidc-` configuration lines.

   ```yaml
   kubeadmconfig:
     clientConfig:
