## Versions Supported

<Tabs queryString="parent">
<TabItem label="23.07.x" value="trident_23.07">

After deploying Trident, you will need to create a backend and a storage class before you can start provisioning volumes
and mounting those to any pods.

### Create a Storage Backend

Trident supports multiple storage backends. Select a supported backend that fits your needs. You can find example of
different backends by reviewing the driver manifests examples in the official Trident
[repository](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/tree/master/trident-installer/sample-input/backends-samples). If you
decide to use one of the example configurations, make sure you update the configuration with your credentials and
environment configurations.

The example below creates a backend with the ONTAP-NAS driver.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: backend-ontap-nas-secret
  namespace: trident
type: Opaque
stringData:
  username: [USERNAME]
  password: [PASSWORD]
---
apiVersion: trident.netapp.io/v1
kind: TridentBackendConfig
metadata:
  name: backend-ontap-nas
  namespace: trident
spec:
  version: 1
  storageDriverName: ontap-nas
  managementLIF: [ONTAP_MANAGEMENT_LIF_IP]
  dataLIF: [DATA_LIF_IP]
  backendName: ontap-nas
  autoExportCIDRs:
    - [x.x.x.x/xx]
  autoExportPolicy: true
  svm: [SVM]
  credentials:
    name: backend-ontap-nas-secret
```

#### Create a Storage Class

Kubernetes supports the ability to bind statically or dynamically provisioned volumes to pods. Statically provisioned
volumes are manually created by a user and then referenced in a deployment. Astra Trident allows you to leverage your
NetApp storage. You must create a storage class before you can request dynamically provisioned volumes.

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: trident-csi
  namespace: trident
provisioner: csi.trident.netapp.io
parameters:
  backendType: "ontap-nas"
  csi.storage.k8s.io/fstype: ext4
```

#### Provision Volumes

An example of provisioning a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC).

```yaml
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: trident-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  storageClassName: trident-csi
```

#### Deploy a Pod and Mount the Volume.

The following code snippet is an example of a pod deployment. The pod contains an Nginx container, with a claim to the
previously created PVC. Once deployed, the PVC with its bound Persistent Volume (PV), will mount to the pod and provide
persistent storage to this application.

```yaml
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: example-pv-pod
  namespace: trident
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: example-pv-vol
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: trident-pvc
  containers:
    - name: example-pv-pod
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: "http-server"
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/usr/share/nginx/html"
          name: example-pv-vol
```
