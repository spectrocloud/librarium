Feature flags allow <PaletteURL text="system administrators" edition={props.edition}  url="/system-management/account-management/#system-administrators" /> to 
manage what features are available to the system's tenants. They can use this capability to roll out new features {prop.edition} tenants in a controlled manner or choose not to implement a feature for their tenants due to security or compliance reasons.

Features enabled by system administrators are applied to all tenants in the system. Once a feature is enabled, it cannot
be disabled.

To learn how to manage feature flags, review the following section for detailed instructions on enabling a feature flag.

## Enable a Feature

Use the following steps to enable a feature flag, but first, ensure your user meets the necessary prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

- You are a system administrator of the type _Operations Administrator_ or _Root Administrator_.

- You have access to the system console.

## Enablement

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1. Log in to the system console. For additional guidance on accessing the system console, check out the
   <PaletteURL
     edition={props.edition}
     text="Access the System Console"
     url="/system-management/#access-the-system-console"
   /> guide.

2. From the left **Main Menu** select **Administration**.

3. Select the **Feature Flags** tab.

4. Locate the feature you want to enable and toggle the switch on the right to enable the feature. You can also search
   for a feature by typing the feature name in the search bar.

## Validate

Use the following steps to validate that the feature flag is enabled.

1. Log in as a tenant administrator to one of the tenants in the system.

2. Depending on the feature, attempt to access it. If the feature is enabled, you will be able to use it. If the feature
   is disabled, you will not be able to access it.

      ) : (
        <VersionedLink text={text} url={`/vertex${url}`} />
      )}
