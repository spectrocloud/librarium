<!-- prettier-ignore -->
Feature flags allows <VersionedLink text="system administrators" url="/vertex/system-management/account-management/#system-administrators" /> manage what features are available to the tenants in the system.
System administrators can use this capability to roll out new features to tenants in a controlled manner, or choose to
not implement a feature for their tenants due to security or compliance reasons.

Features enabled by system administrators are applied to all tenants in the system. Once a feature is enabled, it cannot
be disabled.
