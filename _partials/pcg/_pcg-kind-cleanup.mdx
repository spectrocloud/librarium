To avoid potential vulnerabilities, once your PCG cluster is deployed, remove the `kind` images that were installed
in the environment where you initiated the installation.

Issue the following command to list all instances of `kind` that exist in the environment.

```shell
docker images
```

```shell hideClipboard title="Example output"
REPOSITORY     TAG        IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
kindest/node   v1.26.13   131ad18222cc   5 months ago   910MB
```

Then, use the following command template to remove all instances of `kind`. Replace `<tag>` with your `kind` image tag.

```shell
docker image rm kindest/node:<tag>
```

Consider the following example for reference.

```shell hideClipboard title="Example command"
docker image rm kindest/node:v1.26.13
```

```shell hideClipboard title="Example output"
