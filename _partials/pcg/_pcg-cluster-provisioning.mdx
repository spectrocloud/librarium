The Palette CLI begins provisioning a PCG cluster in your {props.edition} environment. To monitor the progress of the PCG
cluster:

    1. Log in to [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com) as a tenant admin.

    2. From the left main menu, select **Tenant Settings**.

    3. From the **Tenant Settings Menu**, below **Infrastructure**, select **Private Cloud Gateways**.

    4. Select the PCG cluster being deployed. Use the **Events** tab to monitor the deployment progress of your PCG cluster.

If you encounter issues during the installation, refer to our <VersionedLink text="PCG Troubleshooting" url="/troubleshooting/pcg" />
guide. For additional assistance, reach out to our [Customer Support](https://spectrocloud.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals) team.

:::warning

You cannot modify a deployed PCG cluster. If you need to make changes to your PCG cluster, you must delete the existing PCG cluster
and redeploy it with your updated configurations. For this reason, we recommend you save your PCG configuration file for future use. 
Use the Palette CLI `--config-only` flag to save the PCG configuration file without deploying the PCG cluster. Refer to our <VersionedLink text="Generate a Configuration File" url="/automation/palette-cli/commands/pcg#generate-a-configuration-file" /> guide.
