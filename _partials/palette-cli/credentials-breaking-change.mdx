Credentials such as such as Palette API keys, passwords, and Ubuntu Pro tokens set using Palette CLI version 4.7.1 or
earlier are not compatible with Palette CLI version 4.7.2 or later. As a result, users cannot use configuration files
created using version 4.7.1 or earlier to perform Palette CLI operations after upgrading to version 4.7.2 or later.
Refer to our <VersionedLink text="Troubleshooting" url="/troubleshooting/automation#scenario---update-cli-configuration-files-credentials" />
