As we have seen throughout this tutorial, Palette exposes a set of workload metrics out-of-the-box to help cluster
administrators better understand the resource utilization of the cluster. The <VersionedLink text="workload metrics" url="/clusters/cluster-management/workloads/" /> in Palette are a snapshot in
time and do not provide alerting capabilities.

We recommend using a dedicated monitoring system in order to gain a better picture of resource utilization in your
environments. Several <VersionedLink text="packs" url="/integrations/" /> are available in the monitoring category that
you can use to add additional monitoring capabilities to your cluster.

Refer to the <VersionedLink text="Deploy Monitoring Stack" url="/clusters/cluster-management/monitoring/deploy-monitor-stack/"/>
guide to learn how to deploy a monitoring stack using the open-source tool
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) and how to configure a host cluster to forward metrics
to the monitoring stack.
