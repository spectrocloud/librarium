Palette supports [EKS Pod Identity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-identities.html), which allows
pods to securely access AWS services using short-lived credentials. This is achieved by associating an IAM role with a Kubernetes service account, enabling pods that use that service account to assume the IAM role and access AWS resources without needing to manage long-lived AWS credentials.
