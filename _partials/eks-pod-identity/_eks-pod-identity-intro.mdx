[EKS Pod Identity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-identities.html) is a secure authentication
mechanism that allows Kubernetes pods to assume IAM roles with temporary, automatically refreshed credentials. This
eliminates the need for long-lived AWS credentials, addressing security concerns in highly regulated environments where
organizations cannot use long-lived credentials.

:::info

This authentication method is only available for
[self-hosted Palette](../../../enterprise-version/enterprise-version.md) or [Palette VerteX](../../../vertex/vertex.md)
instances deployed on Amazon EKS clusters.
