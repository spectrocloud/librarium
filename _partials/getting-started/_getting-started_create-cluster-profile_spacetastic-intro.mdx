The team are busy exploring and evaluating Palette. In order to prepare for a migration to any external platform, they
begin to map out all the dependencies of their systems and infrastructure.

> Wren begins creating the list. "Our tech stack has grown, as we have added features and capabilities. I remember
> making a lot of design decisions myself, as I was Spacetastic's Founding Engineer. It's really interesting to look

> Kai smiles and nods. "It's definitely been an out-of-this-world ride!" they say. "I have a similar feeling when I
> think about the infrastructure that I built in the early days as Platform Engineer. I will add our infrastructure
> layers to your list. This process has the added bonus of giving us a chance to review which dependencies need to be
> updated, so Meera, our security expert, will be happy too."
