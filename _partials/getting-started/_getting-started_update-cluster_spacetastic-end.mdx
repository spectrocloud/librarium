Wren and Kai have followed this tutorial and now have a great understanding of what cluster profile updates mean to
deployed clusters. They are impressed with Palette's cluster management capabilities.

> "Neat! Palette's cluster profiles allow us to review all updates we apply to our clusters," says Kai. "I can finally
> take my vacation days, once we can safely maintain our clusters."

> "Don't I know the feeling?" laughs Wren. "I think we could all use more vacations, quiet weekends, and less excitement
> when it comes to the Spacetastic platform."
