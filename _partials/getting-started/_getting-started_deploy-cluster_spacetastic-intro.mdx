After successfully creating their first cluster profile and mapping out their entire technology stack, Wren, Founding
Engineer and Kai, Platform Engineer, continue their Palette onboarding process. They are evaluating Palette as a
potential platform orchestration tool for all the production workloads at Spacetastic, who provide an astronomy
education platform deployed on Kubernetes.

> "The Getting Started section is a great way to learn about Palette. The hands-on approach is just what we need to get
> our first cluster deployed." says Kai, scrolling through the Spectro Cloud Docs. "Wren, do you have time to continue
> our onboarding and get our first cluster deployed?"
>
> Wren sits down next to Kai and sips on a cup of coffee. "Now, we'll get a hands-on feel of the Palette developer
> experience. You know me, I'm a champion for developer tooling and always supportive of investing in our platform.
> Let's follow this tutorial and deploy a cluster using the Palette UI."
