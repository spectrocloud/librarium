The Spacetastic team decide to look for an external solution that can help them scale and manage their Kubernetes
services. Partnering with a team of Kubernetes experts allows them to focus on expanding their astronomy education
platform, instead of spending countless hours migrating and rehosting their services. They identify the following list
of benefits that their new platform should provide.

- Simplified Kubernetes cluster deployment processes across cloud providers.
- Cluster maintenance and security patching across environments.
- Monitoring and observability of Kubernetes workloads.

> "I have so many ideas for new features for our backlog." says Anya, Lead Astrophycist. "Our community of space
> explorers want to keep learning, so we shouldn't slow down our implementation cycle. We need to keep expanding our
> astronomy education product."
>
> Kai nods knowingly. As a Platform Engineer, they agree with Anya's concerns. "I've done some research on Kubernetes
> orchestration solutions. It seems that Palette has all the capabilities we need to help us grow."
>
> "I agree with both of you, but I want to review the developer experience in detail before we agree to implement a new
> solution in production." says Wren, whose main concern as Founding Engineer is to ensure development velocity does not
> decrease. "Let's reach out to Spectro Cloud to create an account. Then, we can make an informed decision after we
> complete their Getting Started tutorials."
