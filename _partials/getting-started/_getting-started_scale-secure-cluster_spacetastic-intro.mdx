The team have been impressed with Palette's capabilities and decide to become a Spectro Cloud customer. The last piece
of the puzzle is to learn how to handle Day-2 operations, which become increasingly more important as the Spacetastic
platform matures. They must ensure that their systems are patched, upgraded, scaled, and scanned for vulnerabilities.
These maintenance tasks must be automated and applied on a schedule, as the entire team wants to focus on providing
Spacetastic features.

> "I've read your report on Palette adoption at Spacetastic," says Meera, who provides the security expertise at
> Spacetastic. "I was impressed with the ability to roll out updates to all clusters using the same cluster profile. This
> will streamline our system upgrades and cluster patching. Keeping up with security best practices has never been more
> important, now that we are growing faster than ever!"
>
> "I agree. No matter how safe our coding practices are, we need to periodically review, patch, and upgrade our
> dependencies," says Wren, who leads the engineering team at Spacetastic.

> Kai nods, scrolling through the Palette Docs. "Team, Palette has more security and Day-2 operation support than we
> have explored so far. I will continue their Getting Started section and report back with my findings."
