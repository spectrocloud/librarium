> "What have you found out, Kai?" says Meera walking over to Kai's desk. "Can I rely on Palette when a zero-day
> vulnerability comes in?"
>
> "Yes, I know how stressful it is when those are reported." says Kai with a sympathetic nod. "I found out that Palette
> has our security covered through their pack updates and scanning capabilities. Relying on this kind of tooling is
> invaluable to security conscious engineers like us."

> "Excellent! These capabilities will be a great addition to our existing systems at Spacetastic." says Meera with a big

> "I'm so glad that we found a platform that can support everyone!" says Kai. "There is so much more to explore though.
> I will keep reading through the Getting Started section and find out what additional capabilities Palette provides."
>
> "Good thinking, Kai." says Meera, nodding. "We should maximize all of Palette's features now that we have implemented
> it in production. We've got big ideas and goals on our company roadmap, so let's find out how Palette can help us
> deliver them."
