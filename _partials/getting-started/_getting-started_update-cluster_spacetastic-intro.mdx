> "The streamlined deployment process is just one part of the improvements we've got planned for our platform," says
> Kai. "I'm interested to learn how Palette's cluster profiles behave when applying updates and other changes to our
> clusters."

> Wren nods, knowingly. "Yes, that's critical to avoid future outages like the incidents we’ve had when rolling out new
> features. After all, not every service is greenfield development, so we want services that have streamlined management
> processes too."
