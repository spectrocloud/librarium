Spacetastic Ltd., our fictional example company, is on a mission to teach its users about space. They have assembled a
team of bright minds who are passionate about astronomy and the universe. They are a startup that is gaining popularity,
as they expand their dashboards and grow their subscribers. Their small team has been in charge of developing new
features alongside scaling and maintaining their infrastructure, but they are dedicated to providing the best astronomy
education platform on Planet Earth.

> "I'm the resident space expert around here!" says Anya, Lead Astrophycist, with a beaming smile. "My mission is to
> make astrophysics, the science of space, accessible to everyone."
>
> "I'm here to support you and your mission. I build all the dashboards, pages and features that bring your vast space
> knowledge to our users in a beautiful visual format!" says Wren, Founding Engineer.
>
> Kai smiles and nods. "I work closely with both Wren and Anya. As Platform Engineer, I ensure that our platform is
> reliable and scalable for everyone around the world, and beyond!"
>
> Meera, Head of Cybersecurity, is the final member of the Spacetastic team. "Let's not forget about the security of our
> platform. I make sure that our systems are designed and implemented with security in mind, the true SecDevOps way."

The team has deployed their services to a single cloud provider. They rely on Kubernetes for the reliability and
scalability of their systems. The team must ensure the systems are secure, patched regularly, scalable, and meet a
reliability SLA of at least 99% uptime. The following diagram presents an overview of their systems.

While the system architecture they have chosen was a great place to start, the team soon face common challenges that
many growing organizations encounter with Kubernetes.

> Wren hurriedly walks into the office, looking at their phone with a worried expression. "Users are reporting on social
> media that our systems are down! This must be related to the new feature we have just released."
>
> Meera looks up from their monitor. "I've also received an alert about a new zero-day vulnerability. We need to patch
> our services without further downtime, as soon as you are able to stabilize our platform."
>
> "Team, we need to rethink our platform engineering tools. We need a solution that can help us scale and deploy with
> confidence, ultimately supporting the growth of our company." says Kai with a determined look.
