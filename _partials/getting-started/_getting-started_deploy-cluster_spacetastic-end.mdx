Wren and Kai have deployed their first cluster profile by following the steps described in this tutorial. They were
impressed by how streamlined the process was and how the cluster profiles provided them with a deployment blueprint.

> "Deploying our first cluster with Palette was intuitive." says Wren. "It's ideal to find an external partner that can
> take care of our Kubernetes infrastructure and free us up to deliver more educational features. I definitely think
> that Palette has the capabilities to take care of all the Kubernetes heavy lifting for us."
>
> "I agree with you and I'm glad to hear you're not as skeptical anymore." says Kai, nodding and laughing. "From a
> platform engineering perspective, I can say that cluster profiles will provide us with reliable deployments across
> environments and even clouds, so I'm much more confident about our testing and deployment strategy."
>
> Meera, Head of Cybersecurity, walks in holding a file. "I've done our security due diligence and I'm happy to report
> that Spectro Cloud adheres to the highest security standards. I'm happy to approve Palette for use in our
> organization."
>
> "It seems like we've found a great platform that can support us. Let's explore the rest of the Getting Started section
> to understand what else Palette has to offer." says Kai turning back to their monitor.
