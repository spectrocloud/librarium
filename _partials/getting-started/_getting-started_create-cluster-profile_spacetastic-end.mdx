Wren and Kai have created their first Palette cluster profile by following the steps described in this guide. They are
in good spirits, as the process has gone smoothly.

> "The visual representation of cluster profiles in Palette is much clearer than our whiteboard." says Kai, glancing
> back at the list they have created. "I can keep track of which versions we are using in production just by reviewing
> the profile. What are your thoughts, Wren? Have you remained a Palette skeptic?"
>
> Wren laughs. "Yes, I admit cluster profiles are very convenient. I'm not convinced yet, but I am already starting to
> understand how Palette could make us more productive. Let's keep exploring and get something deployed with it!"
