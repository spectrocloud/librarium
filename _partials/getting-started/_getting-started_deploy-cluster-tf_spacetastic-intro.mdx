After following the tutorials in the Getting Started section, the Spacetastic team have been have been impressed with
its capabilities. Wren, Founding Engineer, and Kai, Platform Engineer, have been discussing adopting IaC workflows and
have been upskilling with Terraform throughout the past year. They are interested in learning if Palette can support IaC
workflows too.

> "While we're on the topic of platform improvements, it would be great to kick off our adoption of Infrastructure as
> Code at Spacetastic." says Wren. "I've been wanting to roll this out for a while, but we don't have that much in-house
> expertise."
>
> "Yes, this would definitely be a big improvement to our processes." says Kai, Platform Engineer. "Some people might
> think that it slows down the development and release processes, due to the extra code reviews. However, the ability to
> revert in the case of an outage more than makes up for this small drop in velocity."
>
> Wren nods, knowingly. "Let's explore Palette's IaC capabilities and maybe we can apply some learnings to our
> infrastructure."
