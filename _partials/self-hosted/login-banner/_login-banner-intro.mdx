{props.official} allows you to add banners, also known as Authority to Operate (ATO) banners, to your {props.edition} instance. There are two types of banners:

- 
  <PaletteVertexUrlMapper
     edition={props.edition}
     text="Login banner"
     url="/system-management/login-banner/#add-login-banner"
   /> - Displays important information to users _before_ they log in to the system console or an individual tenant. These messages must be acknowledged before logging in. Login banners configured in the system console override <VersionedLink text="tenant-specific login banners" url="/tenant-settings/login-banner/"/>.

- 
  <PaletteVertexUrlMapper
     edition={props.edition}
     text="Classification banner"
     url="/system-management/login-banner/#add-classification-banner"
   /> - Displays the type of environment the tenant is working in, such as **CLASSIFIED** or **TOP SECRET**. Classification banners can also be treated as "message-of-the-day" banners, used to convey important information across all system console and tenant screens, including login screens. Classification banners cascade to _all_ tenants and cannot be dismissed.
