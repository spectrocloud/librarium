- A healthy {props.version} management cluster where you can access the Local UI of the leader node.

  - Verify that your local machine can access the Local UI, as airgapped environments may have strict network policies preventing direct access.

- If using an external registry, ensure your local machine has access to the external registry server and you have the necessary permissions to push images to the registry.

  - (Optional) The Palette CLI installed on your local machine if you would like to use it to upload content to your external registry. Refer to the <VersionedLink text="Palette CLI" url="/automation/palette-cli"/> guide for installation instructions.

- Access to the [Artifact Studio](https://artifact-studio.spectrocloud.com/) to download the content bundle for {props.version}.

  - Check that your upgrade path is supported by referring to the <PaletteVertexUrlMapper edition={props.edition} text="Supported Upgrade Paths" url="/upgrade#supported-upgrade-paths"/>.
