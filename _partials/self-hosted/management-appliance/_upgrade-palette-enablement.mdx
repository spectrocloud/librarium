:::info

When using an external registry, you must upload the content bundle to both the external registry and the internal Zot registry as they both need to have the content for the upgrade process. The following steps include instructions for uploading the content bundle to both registries.

:::

1. Navigate to the [Artifact Studio](https://artifact-studio.spectrocloud.com/) through a web browser, and under **Install {props.iso}**, click on the drop-down menu and select the target version for the upgrade.

2. Click **Show Artifacts**, the **{props.iso} Artifacts** pop-up window displays. Click on the **Download** button for the **Content bundle (including Ubuntu)**.

   integrity of downloaded files using the provided signature file.

   :::

4. Open a terminal on your local machine and navigate to the directory where the content bundle file is located.

5. Authenticate with your external registry using the command line or a GUI tool of your choice. The following examples
   demonstrate how to authenticate with an OCI registry using the [`oras`](https://oras.land/docs/) CLI tool and the Palette CLI.

   <Tabs>

   <TabItem label="Harbor" value="harbor">

   Use `oras` to log in to your OCI registry. Replace the values below with your environment configuration values.
   If you are using a Harbor registry with a self-signed certificate, add the `--insecure` flag to the
   `oras` command.

   <Tabs>

   <TabItem label="Regular Certificate" value="regular-certificate">

   ```shell
   oras login <registry-url-or-ip> --username '<username>' --password '<password>'
   ```

   </TabItem>

   <TabItem label="Self-Signed Certificate" value="self-signed-certificate">

   ```shell

   click on the **View push commands** button to access the command. Refer to the
   [AWS ECR Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/getting-started-cli.html#cli-authenticate-registry)
   documentation for more information.

   <Tabs>

   <TabItem label="Private ECR" value="private-ecr">

   Use the following command to authenticate with AWS ECR. The output of the `aws` command is passed to `oras` to
   authenticate with the ECR registry. Replace the values below with your environment configuration values.

   aws ecr get-login-password --region <aws-region> | oras login --username <aws-username> --password-stdin <aws-ecr-url>
   ```

   </TabItem>

   <TabItem label="Public ECR" value="public-ecr">

   For a public image repository, use the `docker` CLI instead of `oras`. Replace the values below with your
   environment configuration values.

   ```shell
   aws ecr-public get-login-password --region <aws-region> | docker login --username <aws-username> --password-stdin <aws-ecr-public-url>
   ```

   </TabItem>

   </Tabs>

   </TabItem>
