- Access to the Artifact Studio to download the {props.iso} pack bundles. Refer to the Artifact Studio
  (link TBC) guide for instructions on how to access and download the bundles.

- Access to your registry depending on the registry type you chose to use for {props.version}.

  - If using the internal Zot registry, ensure you have access to the Local UI of the leader node of the {props.version} management cluster. Also, verify that your local machine can access the Local UI, as airgapped environments may have strict network policies preventing direct access.

  - If using an external registry, ensure your local machine has access to the external registry server and you have the necessary permissions to push images to the registry.

- (Optional) The Palette CLI installed on your local machine if you prefer to use the command line for uploading packs. Refer to the <VersionedLink text="Palette CLI" url="/automation/palette-cli"/> guide for installation instructions.
