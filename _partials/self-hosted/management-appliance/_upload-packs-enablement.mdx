   integrity of the downloaded files.

4. Open a terminal on your local machine and navigate to the directory where the downloaded pack bundles are located.

5. Use the Palette CLI to log in to the internal Zot registry. Replace `<management-vip>` with the VIP address of the {props.version} management cluster, `<username>` with your username, and `<password>` with your password. If you have changed the default port for the Zot registry, replace `30003` with the correct port number.

   ```shell
   palette content registry-login \
   --registry https://<management-vip>:30003 \
   --username <username> \
   --password <password>
   ```

6. Upload the pack bundles to the internal Zot registry using the Palette CLI. Replace `<pack-zst>` with your downloaded pack bundle file and `<management-vip>` with the VIP address of the {props.version} management cluster.
