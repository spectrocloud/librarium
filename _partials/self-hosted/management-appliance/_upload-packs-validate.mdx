1. Log in to the Local UI of the leader host of the {props.version} management cluster.

<TabItem value="external-registry" label="External Registry">

1. Check that the packs have been successfully uploaded to your external registry using the Palette CLI. Replace `<registry-dns-or-ip>` with the DNS/IP address of your registry, `<registry-port>` with the port number of your registry (if applicable), and `<image-repository>` with the name of the image repository. If you have changed the base content path from the default, replace `spectro-content` with the correct content path.

   If you are using custom TLS certificates or choosing to skip TLS, use the appropriate flags as shown in the following examples.
