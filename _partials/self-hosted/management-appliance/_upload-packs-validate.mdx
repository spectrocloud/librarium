   Be aware of the timeout period for the authentication token. The process of uploading images and packages to an OCI
   registry can take approximately an hour. If the authentication token expires, you will need to re-authenticate to
   the OCI registry and restart the upload process.

2. Check that the pack bundles you uploaded are listed in the output as repositories.
