- Access to the [Artifact Studio](https://artifact-studio.spectrocloud.com/) to download the Third Party packs.

  :::tip

  If you do not have access to Artifact Studio, contact your Spectro Cloud representative or [open a support ticket](https://support.spectrocloud.com/).

  :::

- If using the internal Zot registry, ensure you have access to the Local UI of the leader node of the {props.version} management cluster. Also, verify that your local machine can access the Local UI, as airgapped environments may have strict network policies preventing direct access.

  - (Optional) The Palette CLI installed on your local machine if you prefer to use the command line for uploading packs. Refer to the <VersionedLink text="Palette CLI" url="/automation/palette-cli"/> guide for installation instructions.

- If using an external registry, the Palette CLI must be installed on your local machine to upload the content to the external registry. Refer to the <VersionedLink text="Palette CLI" url="/automation/palette-cli"/> guide for installation instructions.

  - Ensure your local machine has network access to the external registry server and you have the necessary permissions to push images to the registry.
