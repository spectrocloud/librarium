Use the following steps to verify that the endpoint was updated successfully.

1. Export your {props.edition} credentials as environment variables. Replace `<cluster-url>` with the
address of your {props.edition} cluster and `<sys-admin-password>` with the system administrator password.

    ```shell
    export ENDPOINT=<cluster-url>
    export PASSWORD=<sys-admin-password>
    ```

2. Log in to the Palette System API using the `/v1/auth/syslogin` endpoint. The response will contain the authentication token that you will use in the next request.

    ```shell
    AUTH_TOKEN=$(curl --location "${ENDPOINT}/v1/auth/syslogin" \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
        "username": "admin",
        "password": "'${PASSWORD}'"
    }' | jq ."Authorization")
    ```

    :::tip

    If your cluster is using the default self-signed certificate, you can use the `--insecure` flag with the `curl` commands
    to bypass the certificate check.

3. Use the `/v1/system/config/scar` endpoint to confirm that the SCAR endpoint has been correctly updated.

    ```shell
    curl --location "${ENDPOINT}/v1/system/config/scar" \
    --header "Cookie: Authorization=${AUTH_TOKEN}"
    ```

    The output should contain the updated SCAR endpoint.
