- A deployed self-hosted {props.edition} <PaletteVertexUrlMapper
    edition={props.edition}
    text="cluster"
    palettePath="/install-palette"
    vertexPath="/install-palette-vertex"
  /> that uses a customer-managed SCAR to host {props.edition}
  manifests.
- Access to the {props.edition} cluster kubeconfig file to verify the SCAR endpoint.

  :::tip

  If you deployed {props.edition} using the Palette CLI, you can download the kubeconfig file from the {props.edition} cluster details
  page in the system console. Navigate to the **Enterprise Cluster Migration** page and click on the **Admin
  Kubeconfig** link to download the kubeconfig file. If you deployed {props.edition} to an existing Kubernetes cluster, contact
  your cluster administrator to obtain the kubeconfig file. For instructions on using the kubeconfig file to access your
  cluster, refer to the <VersionedLink text="Access Cluster with CLI" url="/clusters/cluster-management/palette-webctl"/>.

  :::

- Access to the file server that hosts the {props.edition} manifests.
- Ensure the Kubernetes cluster has a Container Storage Interface (CSI) available and at least 10 GB of free space. The Specman service requires this to create a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) for storing content.
- The {props.edition} cluster must have been upgraded to version `4.5.15` or later. This is required for the SCAR migration to
  function properly.
- Access to the {props.edition} system console.
- Ensure the following software is installed and available in the environment hosting the file server. For example, if
  you deployed an airgapped instance of {props.edition} to VMware using an <PaletteVertexUrlMapper
    edition={props.edition}
    text="OVA"
    palettePath="/install-palette/install-on-vmware/airgap-install/environment-setup/vmware-vsphere-airgap-instructions"
    vertexPath="/install-palette-vertex/install-on-vmware/airgap-install/environment-setup/vmware-vsphere-airgap-instructions"
  />, these tools must be available on your airgap support VM.
