The {props.edition} installation process requires users to configure and maintain an HTTP server to host {props.edition} manifests. This
server is known as the Spectro Cloud Artifact Regisry (SCAR). Alternatively, users now have the option to migrate these
manifests to the same OCI registry that hosts the {props.edition} images and packs. This migration is handled by a service
called Specman, which fetches the manifests from the OCI registry and serves them via an internal HTTP server.

The migration process involves two main steps:

- Pushing the {props.edition} manifests to the OCI registry.
- Updating the SCAR endpoint to point to the new internal HTTP server.

Once the migration is complete, there is no longer a need to maintain a separate file server exclusively for hosting the
{props.edition} manifests.

This guide will direct you through the steps required to push the {props.edition} manifests to the OCI registry and update the
SCAR endpoint.
