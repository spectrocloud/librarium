You can configure a Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) server to send emails on behalf of your {props.version}
instance. An SMTP server is required to change the email address of the admin user and to send the initial tenant
invitation email.

SMTP servers can be authenticated with a username and password or anonymously. 

:::warning

Anonymous SMTP configuration introduces additional security risks. We recommend using authenticated SMTP whenever possible.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the
  <PaletteVertexUrlMapper
     edition={props.edition}
     text="system console"
     url="/system-management/#access-the-system-console"
   />.

- SMTP server details such as the host name and port number. If you are using authenticated SMTP instead of anonymous SMTP, your SMTP server username and password are also required.

- The outgoing SMTP port must be open on the cluster to allow {props.version} to send emails.

## Configure SMTP

1. Log in to the system console.

2. From the left main menu, select **Administration**.

3. Select the **SMTP** tab.

4. Fill out the following fields.

    | **Field**                    | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                           | **Required** |
    | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
    | **Insecure Skip TLS Verify** | {props.tls_description}  | {props.tls_required} |
    | **Outgoing Server**          | The host name of the SMTP server. For example, `smtp.gmail.com`.                                                                                                                           | Yes |
    | **Outgoing Port**            | The port number of the SMTP server.                                                                                                                                                       | Yes |
    | **From Email**               | Emails sent by {props.version} will use this email address as the sender.                                                                      | Yes |
    | **Username**                 | The username of the SMTP server. This is required for authenticated SMTP. If you are using anonymous SMTP, do not include a username or password.                                                                                                                                                         | No |
    | **Password**                 | The password of the SMTP server. This is required for authenticated SMTP. Certain SMTP servers, such as `smtp.gmail.com`, require app passwords instead of user passwords. If you are using anonymous SMTP configuration, do not include a username or password.                                                                                                                                                         | No |

5. Select **Validate configuration**. A success message is displayed if the configuration is valid; otherwise, an error message is displayed. For additional error details, refer to the {props.version} `system-<ID>-<ID>` container logs, located in the `hubble-system` namespace.

6. **Save** your changes.

    If you are using anonymous SMTP, a security message is displayed. If possible, update your configuration to use authenticated SMTP. The system console reminds you that you are using an anonymous SMTP configuration by displaying a warning icon beside **Connection**.

## Validate

The SMTP configuration is validated when you select **Validate configuration**. A success message is displayed if the configuration is valid; otherwise, an error message is displayed. For additional error details, refer to the {props.version} `system-<ID>-<ID>` container logs, located in the `hubble-system` namespace.
