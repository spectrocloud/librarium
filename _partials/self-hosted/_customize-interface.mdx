You can customize the following user interface elements for {props.version} installations to fit your brand:

- Login and forgot password screens, including the logo, **Sign in to your tenant** icon, login panel image, primary button, and border color of the text fields. 

- Expanded tenant sidebar, including the logo and color.

- Minimized tenant sidebar, including the logo and color.

- Favicon on all {props.reference} screens.

- Documentation URLs, including the login screen and all other links throughout {props.reference}.

## Limitations

- Interface customization applies only to the tenant login screen, forgot password screen, and other {props.reference} tenant screens. Changes do not cascade to the system console.

- Modifying the documentation URL changes the `docs.spectrocloud.com` domain for all documentation links throughout {props.reference}. To ensure the **Learn More** links in the UI function correctly, you must host your own documentation site based on Spectro Cloud's [librarium](https://github.com/spectrocloud/librarium) repository. Spectro Cloud does not manage or maintain downstream versions of its documentation.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the {props.andor} 
    <PaletteVertexUrlMapper
        edition={props.edition}
        text="system console"
        url="/system-management/#access-the-system-console"
      /> .

- Root Administrator or Operations Administrator permissions. Refer to the 
  <PaletteVertexUrlMapper
     edition={props.edition}
     text="Account Management"
     url="/system-management/account-management"
   /> page to learn more.

## Enablement

1. Log in to the {props.reference} system console. For additional guidance, check out the
    <PaletteVertexUrlMapper
        edition={props.edition}
        text="Access the System Console"
        url="/system-management/#access-the-system-console"
    /> guide.

2. From the left main menu, select **Administration**. 

3. Navigate to the **Customize interface** tab. From here, you can customize the login screen, tenant sidebar, favicon, and documentation domain to fit your brand's needs. The **Preview** pane is updated to reflect your changes.

        ![The Customize interface tab of the Administration tab](/enterprise-version_system-management_customize-interface.webp)

    The following table describes the various customization elements on each **Customize interface** panel. At any point, you can choose **Reset to default** to revert to the default {props.reference} theme, resetting _all_ interface customization. To revert to the default {props.reference} logo for a certain element, select the **X** button beside your uploaded image.

    :::info

    All logo images must be in PNG or SVG format. For best results, we recommend using images that are landscape oriented and do not exceed 1 MB in size. If you do not upload a logo, the default {props.reference} logo is used.

If the URL is changed to a domain that is not based on Spectro Cloud's documentation, **Learn More** links within the UI will not function. Refer to the <PaletteVertexUrlMapper edition={props.edition} text="Limitations" url="/system-management/customize-interface/#limitations" /> section for more information. |

    | **Favicon**           | **Logo** | Change the favicon used for all {props.reference} screens. The logo should have a maximum width of 32px and a maximum height of 32px. |

2. Log in to {props.reference}. If you made any favicon or sidebar changes, verify the changes have been applied. If you changed the documentation URL, verify that the **Docs** link beside the **User Menu** takes you to the expected domain.
