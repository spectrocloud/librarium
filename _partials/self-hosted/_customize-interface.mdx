You can customize the following user interface elements for {props.version} installations to fit your brand:

- Login and forgot password windows, including the logo, **Sign in to your tenant** icon, hero image, and primary button and outline colors. 

- Expanded sidebar, including the logos and colors.

- Minimized sidebar, including the logos and colors.

- Favicon, which is present on the login and forgot password windows, as well as all other {props.version} screens.

- Documentation URLs, including the login window and all other links throughout {props.version} screens.

## Limitations

- Interface customization applies only to the login screen, forgot password screen, and across {props.version}. Changes do not cascade to the system console.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the {props.andor} 
    <PaletteVertexUrlMapper
        edition={props.edition}
        text="system console"
        url="/system-management/#access-the-system-console"
      /> .
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
- Root Administrator or Operations Administrator permissions. Refer to the 
  <PaletteVertexUrlMapper
     edition={props.edition}
     text="System Administrators"
     url="/system-management/account-management"
   /> page to learn more.

## Enablement

1. Log in to the system console. For additional guidance, check out the
    <PaletteVertexUrlMapper
        edition={props.edition}
        text="Access to the System Console"
        url="/system-management/#access-the-system-console"
    /> guide.

2. From the left **Main Menu**, select **Administration**. 

3. Navigate to the **Customize interface** tab. From here, you can customize the login window, sidebar, favicon, and documentation domain to fit your brand's needs. The **Preview** pane is updated to reflect your changes.

    The following table describes the various customization elements on each **Customize interface** tab. At any point, you can choose **Reset to default** to revert to the default Palette theme, resetting _all_ interface customization.

    :::info

    All logo images must be in PNG or SVG format. For best results, we recommend using images that are landscape oriented and do not exceed 1 MB in size. If you do not upload a logo, the default {props.edition} logo is used.

    | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
    | **Login**             | **Show hero image** | Display or hide the hero image on the login and forgot password screens.  | 
    | | **Logo** | Change the logo on the login screen. The logo should have a maximum width of 180px and a maximum height of 67px. | 
    | | **Primary button color** | Change the color of the **Sign in** and **Reset Password** buttons, as well as the outline color of the **Email** and **Password** fields. | 
    | | **Documentation URL** | Change the default domain of all documentation links throughout {props.version}. If this is changed, "learn more" links within the UI will no longer function, as the `docs.spectrocloud.com` domain is replaced with your designated domain, creating invalid URLs. | 
    | **Sidebar**           | **Logo** | Change the logo on the sidebar (expanded and minimized). The logo should have a maximum width of 180px and a maximum height of 67px. |
    | | **Sidebar background color** | Change the background color of the sidebar (expanded and minimized). | 
    | | **Show Spectro Cloud logo** | Display or hide the Spectro Cloud logo at the bottom of the sidebar (expanded and minimized). |
    | **Minimized Sidebar** | **Logo** | Use a different logo when the sidebar is minimized. This logo is also used on the {props.version} login screen beside **Sign in to your tenant**. The logo should have a maximum width of 180px and a maximum height of 67px. |
    | **Favicon**           | **Logo** | Change the favicon used for the login screen and on {props.version} screens. The logo should have a maximum width of 32px and a maximum height of 32px. |

4. When you are finished, select **Save changes**.

## Validation

1. Proceed to the login page of Palette. If you made any login screen or favicon changes, verify the changes have been applied. If you changed the documentation URL, verify that documentation link takes you to the expected domain.

2. Log in to {props.edition}. If you made any favicon or sidebar changes, verify the changes have been applied. If you changed the documentation URL, verify that the **Docs** link beside the **User Menu** takes you to the expected domain.
