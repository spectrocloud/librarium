- An RHEL airgap VM deployed in your VMware vSphere. The VM must be registered with
  [Red Hat](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/253273) and have ports `80` and `443` available. This guide uses RHEL
  version `8.8` as an example.

- The RHEL VM must have a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) that is DNS resolvable and must be accessible via SSH.

- The RHEL VM must have Podman installed.

- An HTTP file server installed within the RHEL VM to host the {props.edition} files. The file server must serve files from the
  `/var/www/html` directory and have SSL support enabled. Below is a list of common file servers. This guide uses Apache
  as an example.

  - [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/)

  - [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)

  - [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)

  :::warning

  Take the necessary steps to secure your file server and ensure it can automatically recover from failure. The file
  server is a critical component of the airgap installation and must be available post-install for {props.edition} to function
  properly.

  :::

- Review the required vSphere <VersionedLink text="permissions" url="/enterprise-version/install-palette/install-on-vmware/vmware-system-requirements/" /> and ensure you have
  created the proper custom roles and zone tags. Zone tagging enables dynamic storage allocation across fault domains
  when provisioning workloads that require persistent storage. Refer to <VersionedLink text="Zone Tagging" url="/enterprise-version/install-palette/install-on-vmware/vmware-system-requirements/" /> for information.

- The following artifacts must be available in the root home directory of the RHEL airgap VM. You can download the files
  in a system with internet access and then transfer them to your airgap environment. Contact your {props.edition} support
  representative to obtain the latest version of each artifact.
  - RHEL airgap appliance binary. This guide uses version `4.4.2` of the binary as an example.
  - {props.edition} installation binary. This guide uses version `4.4.14` of the binary as an example.
