Now that you have installed {props.edition}, you can either
    <PaletteVertexUrlMapper
        edition={props.edition}
        text="create a tenant"
        url="/system-management/tenant-management"
    /> to host your users and set up your clusters, or you can
    <PaletteVertexUrlMapper
        edition={props.edition}
        text="activate your installation"
        url="/activate-installation"
    /> .     

Beginning with version 4.6.c, once you install {props.edition}, you have 30 days to activate it; versions older than 4.6.c do not need to be activated. During the 30-day trial period, you can use {props.edition} without any restrictions. After 30 days, you can continue to use {props.edition}, but you cannot deploy additional clusters or perform any day-2 operations on existing clusters until {props.edition} is activated. Each installation of {props.edition} must be activated separately. We recommend activating {props.edition} as soon as possible to avoid any disruptions.
