Now that you have installed {props.version}, you can either
    <PaletteVertexUrlMapper
        edition={props.edition}
        text="create a tenant"
        url="/system-management/tenant-management"
    /> to host your users and set up your clusters, or you can
    <PaletteVertexUrlMapper
        edition={props.edition}
        install={props.install}
        text="activate your installation"
        url="/activate"
    /> .     

Beginning with version 4.6.32, once you install {props.version}, you have 30 days to activate it; versions older than 4.6.32 do not need to be activated. During the 30-day trial period, you can use {props.version} without any restrictions. After 30 days, you can continue to use {props.version}, but you cannot deploy additional clusters or perform any day-2 operations on existing clusters until {props.version} is activated. Each installation of {props.version} must be activated separately. We recommend activating {props.version} as soon as possible to avoid any disruptions.

Palette is installed with a self-signed SSL certificate. To assign a different SSL certificate you must upload the SSL certificate, SSL certificate key, and SSL certificate authority files to Palette. You can upload the files using the Palette system console. Refer to the
<PaletteVertexUrlMapper
        edition={props.edition}
        install={props.install}
        text="Configure HTTPS Encryption"
        url="/system-management/ssl-certificate-management"
    /> page for instructions on how to upload the SSL certificate files to Palette.
