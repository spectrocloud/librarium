Now that you have installed {props.version}, you can either
    <PaletteVertexUrlMapper
        edition={props.edition}
        text="create a tenant"
        url="/system-management/tenant-management"
    /> to host your users and set up your clusters, or you can
    <PaletteVertexUrlMapper
        edition={props.edition}
        install={props.install}
        text="activate your installation"
        url="/activate"
    /> .     

Beginning with version 4.6.32, once you install {props.version}, you have 30 days to activate it; versions older than 4.6.32 do not need to be activated. During the 30-day trial period, you can use {props.version} without any restrictions. After 30 days, you can continue to use {props.version}, but you cannot deploy additional clusters or perform any day-2 operations on existing clusters until {props.version} is activated. Each installation of {props.version} must be activated separately. We recommend activating {props.version} as soon as possible to avoid any disruptions.
