By default, {props.edition} connects to the internet to download images and packages. If your environment uses a proxy server, ensure the
following domains and ports are accessible. The proxy server should meet the following requirements:

- A proxy used for outgoing connections should support both HTTP and HTTPS traffic.

- If you are deploying {props.edition} to a vSphere environment. Ensure the instance Palette is installed through network has
  access to vCenter.

- Allow connectivity to domains and ports in the table.


<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- Review the <VersionedLink text="gRPC and Proxies" url="/architecture/grps-proxy/"  /> page to learn more about {props.edition}'s support for gRPC in a proxy environment.
