Validation steps vary based on the feature enabled. In general, if you do not activate a feature, you cannot view any
options related to the feature.

For example, if you enable the **AwsSecretPartition** feature flag in Palette VerteX, the option **AWS US Secret** is
available from the **Partition** drop-down menu at **Tenant Settings > Cloud Accounts > Add AWS Account**, and you can
select your AWS Secret cloud account when deploying an EKS cluster. Likewise, if you do not enable the
**AwsSecretPartition** feature flag, you do not have the option to register an AWS Secret cloud account and cannot
deploy clusters to AWS Secret cloud.
