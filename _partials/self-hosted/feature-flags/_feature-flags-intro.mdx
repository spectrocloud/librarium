Feature flags allow <PaletteVertexUrlMapper edition={props.edition} text="system administrators" url="/system-management/account-management#system-administrators" />
to manage certain features available to the system's tenants. Use this capability to roll out new features to tenants in a
controlled manner or prevent tenants from using Tech Preview features in production environments.

Features enabled by system administrators apply to all tenants in the system. Once a feature is enabled, it cannot be
disabled for security and stability purposes. All feature flags are Tech Preview features. When a feature graduates from
Tech Preview, the feature flag is removed, and the feature is automatically enabled for all tenants.

The following table lists all available feature flags and their supported platforms.

| **Feature Flag**       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | **Palette Support** | **Palette VerteX Support** |

We recommend enabling features in test environment first, as certain
features may have a significant impact on your production environment and current workloads.
