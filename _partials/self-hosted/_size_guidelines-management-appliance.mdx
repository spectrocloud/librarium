This section lists resource requirements for {props.edition} for various capacity levels. In {props.edition}, the terms _small_,
_medium_, and _large_ are used to describe the instance size of worker pools that Palette is installed on. The following
table lists the resource requirements for each size.

<br />

:::warning

The recommended maximum number of deployed nodes and clusters in the environment should not be exceeded. We have tested
the performance of {props.edition} with the recommended maximum number of deployed nodes and clusters. Exceeding these limits
can negatively impact performance and result in instability. The active workload limit refers to the maximum number of
active nodes and pods at any given time.

:::info

The Spectro manifest requires approximately 10 GB of storage. {props.edition} deployed clusters use the manifest to identify what images to pull for each microservice that makes up {props.edition}.

#### Instance Sizing

| **Configuration**    | **Active Workload Limit**                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Small                | Up to 1000 nodes each with 30 pods (30,000 pods)  |
| Medium (Recommended) | Up to 3000 nodes each with 30 pods (90,000 pods)  |
| Large                | Up to 5000 nodes each with 30 pods (150,000 pods) |
