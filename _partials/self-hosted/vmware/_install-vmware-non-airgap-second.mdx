5.  Append an `r_` prefix to the imported OVA name. If the name includes the `.ova` suffix, remove it. For example,
    `r_u-2204-0-k-12813-0` is a valid OVA name. This naming convention is required for the installation process to
    detect the OVA.

6.  Open a terminal window and set your Palette CLI encryption passphrase value in an environment variable. The
    passphrase must be eight to 32 characters long and include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one
    digit, and one special character. Refer to the
    [Palette CLI Encryption](../../../../../../automation/palette-cli/#encryption) section for more
    information.

    Use the following command to set the passphrase. Replace `*************` with your passphrase.

    ```shell
    export PALETTE_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD=*************
    ```
