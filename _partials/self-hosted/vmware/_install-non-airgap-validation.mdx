Validate that a three-node Kubernetes cluster is launched and {props.version} is deployed on it.

1. Log in to the vCenter Server by using vSphere Client.

2. Navigate to your vSphere data center and locate your {props.version} VM instances. The VMs are prefixed with the `kind` cluster name you provided during the installation. For example, if you provided `spectro-mgmt-cluster` as the name, the VMs are named `spectro-mgmt-cluster-`, followed by a unique set of alphanumeric values. Verify three nodes are available.

3. Open a web browser session, and use the IP address provided by the installer at the completion of the installation to connect to the {props.version} system console. Copy the IP address to the address bar and append `/system`.

4. Log in using your credentials.

5. A **Summary** page appears with a **Go to Tenant Management** button. After the initial installation, the **Summary** page displays that there are zero tenants.
