- A physical or virtual Linux machine with AMD64 (also known as x86_64) processor architecture and network connectivity to your VMware vCenter environment.

- The following software installed and available on the Linux host:

  - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) or equivalent container runtime.

  - Palette CLI. Refer to the [Palette CLI
  installation guideline](../../../../../automation/palette-cli/install-palette-cli.md#download-and-setup).

- The required custom roles created according to the [VMware System and Permission Requirements](../setup/non-airgap/vmware-system-requirements.md).

- Zone tagging configured in your vSphere environment. Refer to [Zone Tagging](../setup/non-airgap/vmware-system-requirements.md#zone-tagging) for more information.

- The following network ports accessible:

  - TCP/443: Inbound to and outbound from the {props.version} management cluster.

  - TCP/6443: Outbound traffic from the {props.version} management cluster to the deployed cluster's Kubernetes API server.

- An SSL certificate that matches the domain name you will assign to {props.version}. The certificate is required to
  enable HTTPS encryption for {props.version}. Reach out to your network administrator or security team to obtain the SSL
  certificate. The following files are required:

  - x509 SSL certificate file in base64 format.

  - x509 SSL certificate key file in base64 format.

  Additionally, the following file is optional:

  - x509 SSL certificate authority file in base64 format.
  {props.sslwarning}
- Assigned IP addresses for application workload services, such as Load Balancer.

- {props.version}'s access to the required domains and ports. Refer to the
  [Required Domains](../install/install.md#proxy-requirements) section for more information.

- A [StorageClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/) to manage persistent storage, with the
  annotation `storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class` set to `true`. To override the default StorageClass for a
  workload, modify the `storageClass` parameter. Refer to the
  [Change the default StorageClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/change-default-storage-class/)
  page to learn more about modifying StorageClasses.

  :::info

  Self-hosted {props.version} installations provide a system Private Cloud Gateway (PCG) out-of-the-box and typically do not
  require a separate, user-installed PCG. However, you can create additional PCGs as needed to support provisioning into
  remote data centers that do not have a direct incoming connection from the {props.version} console. To learn how to install a
  PCG on VMware, refer to the [VMware PCG](../../../../../clusters/pcg/deploy-pcg/vmware.md) guide.
