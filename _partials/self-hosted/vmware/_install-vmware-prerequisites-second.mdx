  /> section for more information.

- A [StorageClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/) to manage persistent storage, with the
  annotation `storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class` set to `true`. To override the default StorageClass for a
  workload, modify the `storageClass` parameter. Refer to the
  [Change the default StorageClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/change-default-storage-class/)
  page to learn more about modifying StorageClasses.

:::info

Self-hosted {props.version} installations provide a system Private Cloud Gateway (PCG) out-of-the-box and typically do not
require a separate, user-installed PCG. However, you can create additional PCGs as needed to support provisioning into
remote data centers that do not have a direct incoming connection from the {props.version} console. To learn how to install a
PCG on VMware, refer to the [VMware PCG](../../../../../../clusters/pcg/deploy-pcg/vmware/) guide.
