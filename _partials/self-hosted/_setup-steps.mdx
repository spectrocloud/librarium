1.  Log in to your vCenter environment.

2.  Create a vSphere template folder named `spectro-templates`. Ensure you can access this folder with the user account
    you plan to use when deploying the {props.edition} installation.

3.  Right-click on your cluster or resource group and select **Deploy OVF Template**.

4.  In the **Deploy OVF Template** wizard, enter the following URL to import the Operating System (OS) and Kubernetes
    distribution OVA required for the {props.edition} nodes creation. Contact your {props.edition} support representative to learn if
    the version of {props.edition} you are using requires a new OS and Kubernetes OVA.

    ```url
    https://vmwaregoldenimage-console.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/u-2204-0-k-1282-0.ova
    ```

    Place the OVA in the **spectro-templates** folder. Append the `r_` prefix, and remove the `.ova` suffix when
    assigning its name and target location. For example, the final output should look like `r_u-2204-0-k-1282-0`. This
    naming convention is required for the installation process to identify the OVA. Refer to the
    <VersionedLink text="Additional Packs" url="/enterprise-version/install-palette/airgap/supplemental-packs/" /> page for a list of additional OS and
    Kubernetes OVAs.

    You can terminate the deployment after the OVA is available in the `spectro-templates` folder. Refer to the
    [Deploy an OVF or OVA Template](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-vm-administration/GUID-AFEDC48B-C96F-4088-9C1F-4F0A30E965DE.html)
    guide for more information about deploying an OVA in vCenter.

    :::warning

    If you encounter an error message during the OVA deployment stating that vCenter is unable to retrieve a manifest or
    certificate, refer to this [known issue](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/79986) from VMware's knowledge base for
    guidance on how to resolve the issue.

    :::

5.  Open a terminal window and SSH into the RHEL airgap VM as a root user with the command below. Replace
    `/path/to/private_key` with the path to your private SSH key, `docs` with the username, and `palette.example.com`
    with the FQDN of the RHEL airgap VM.

    ```shell
    ssh -i /path/to/private_key docs@palette.example.com
    ```

6.  Switch to the `root` user account to complete the remaining steps.

    ```shell
    sudo --login
    ```

7.  Set the VM timezone to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

    ```shell
    timedatectl set-timezone UTC
    ```

8.  Ensure that ports `80` and `443` are not in use by your file server, as these ports will be used by the Harbor
    registry that will be installed later.

    Open the `/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf` file and make the following changes:

    - Replace the line `Listen 443 https` with `Listen 8443 https`.
    - Replace the line `<VirtualHost _default_:443>` with `<VirtualHost _default_:8443>`.

    Save and exit the file.

9.  Next, open the `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` file and replace the line `Listen 80` with `Listen 8080`. Save and exit
    the file.

10. Restart the Apache HTTP server to apply the configuration changes.

    ```shell
    systemctl restart httpd.service
    ```

11. Allow TCP traffic on ports `80`, `8080`, `443`, and `8443`, then reload the firewall.

    ```shell
    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp
    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8080/tcp
    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=443/tcp
    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8443/tcp
    firewall-cmd --reload
    ```

    The output displays a success message.

    ```text hideClipboard
    success
    ```

12. Set the `AIRGAP_BUILD` variable as `true`. This is required for the RHEL airgap appliance binary.

    ```shell
    export AIRGAP_BUILD=true
    ```

13. Start the RHEL airgap appliance binary, which installs the tools and configures the manifests that are required to
    set up the Harbor registry and push images.

    ```shell
    chmod +x ./airgap-appliance-<version>-rhel-podman.bin && ./airgap-appliance-<version>-rhel-podman.bin
    ```

    Consider the following example for reference.

    ```shell
    chmod +x ./airgap-appliance-v4.4.2-rhel-podman.bin && ./airgap-appliance-v4.4.2-rhel-podman.bin
    ```

    ```text hideClipboard

14. Reboot your RHEL VM to apply the changes.

    ```shell
    reboot
    ```

    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    Your SSH connection will be terminated. Start a new SSH session and switch to `sudo` mode before proceeding. Use
    the same commands from steps **5**, **6**, and **12** of this guide.

15. Issue the following command to configure the Harbor registry. Replace `palette.example.com` with the FQDN of the
    RHEL airgap VM. The script will generate a self-signed certificate for the value you provide.

    ```shell
    /bin/airgap-setup.sh palette.example.com
    ```

    The script output should look similar to the example below. It contains the credentials and values you will need when
    completing the installation with the Palette CLI. If you need to review this information in the future, invoke the
    script again.

16. Update the SSL certificate file and key in the **httpd** service.

    :::warning

    You can skip this step if you do not plan to use the local Spectro Cloud Artifact Repository (SCAR) during the
    [{props.edition} installation](#next-steps) process.

    :::

    Open the `/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf` file and add the path to the certificate and key generated in step **15** of
    this guide:

    - Replace the line `SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt` with
      `SSLCertificateFile  /opt/spectro/ssl/server.crt`.
    - Replace the line `SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key` with
      `SSLCertificateKeyFile /opt/spectro/ssl/server.key`.

    Save and exit the file. Next, restart the HTTP server to apply the changes.

    ```shell
    systemctl restart httpd.service
    ```

17. Start the {props.edition} installation binary, which uploads release-specific {props.edition} images and packs to the Harbor registry.

    ```shell
    chmod +x airgap-<version>.bin && ./airgap-<version>.bin
    ```
    
    Consider the following example for reference.

    ```shell
    chmod +x airgap-4-4-14.bin && ./airgap-4-4-14.bin
    ```

    This step may take some time to complete. A `Setup Completed` message confirms it is finished.

18. Grant the Apache user and group the necessary permissions to serve the files in the `/var/www/html` directory.

    ```shell
    chown -R apache.apache /var/www/html
    ```

    Restart the HTTP server to apply the changes.

    ```shell
    systemctl restart httpd.service
    ```
