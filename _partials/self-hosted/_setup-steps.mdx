## Prerequisites

- An RHEL airgap VM deployed in VMware vSphere. The VM must be registered with
  [Red Hat](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/253273) and have ports `80` and `443` available. This guide uses RHEL
  version `9.4` as an example.

- The RHEL VM must have a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) that is DNS resolvable and must be accessible via SSH.

- The RHEL VM must have Podman installed.

- An HTTP file server installed within the RHEL VM to host the {props.edition} files. The file server must serve files from the
  `/var/www/html` directory and have SSL support enabled. Below is a list of common file servers. This guide uses Apache
  as an example.

  - [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/)

  - [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)

  - [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)

  :::warning

  Take the necessary steps to secure your file server and ensure it can automatically recover from failure. The file
  server is a critical component of the airgap installation and must be available post-install for {props.edition} to function
  properly.

  :::

- Review the required vSphere <PaletteVertexUrlMapper text="permissions" edition={props.edition} install={props.install} url="/setup/non-airgap/vmware-system-requirements/" /> and ensure you have
  created the proper custom roles and zone tags. Zone tagging enables dynamic storage allocation across fault domains
  when provisioning workloads that require persistent storage. Refer to <VersionedLink text="Zone Tagging" edition={props.edition} install={props.install} url="/setup/non-airgap/vmware-system-requirements/#zone-tagging" /> for information.

- The following artifacts must be available in the root home directory of the RHEL airgap VM. You can download the files
  in a system with internet access and then transfer them to your airgap environment. Contact your {props.edition} support
  representative to obtain the latest version of each artifact.
  - RHEL airgap appliance binary.
  - {props.edition} airgap installation binary.

## Prepare for Airgap Installation

1.  Log in to your vCenter environment.

2.  Create a vSphere template folder named `spectro-templates`. Ensure you can access this folder with the user account
    you plan to use when deploying the {props.edition} installation.

3.  Right-click on your cluster or resource group and select **Deploy OVF Template**.

4.  In the **Deploy OVF Template** wizard, enter the following URL to import the Operating System (OS) and Kubernetes
    distribution OVA required for the {props.edition} nodes creation. Refer to the 
    <VersionedLink text="Kubernetes Requirements" url={props.requirementsURL} /> section to learn if the version of
    {props.edition} you are installing requires a new OS and Kubernetes OVA.
    
    <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="non-fips" label="Non-FIPS">

    ```url
    https://vmwaregoldenimage-console.s3.amazonaws.com/u-2204-0-k-1294-0.ova
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="fips" label="FIPS">

    ```url
    https://vmwaregoldenimage-console.s3.amazonaws.com/u-2004-0-k-1294-fips.ova
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    Place the OVA in the **spectro-templates** folder. Append the `r_` prefix, and remove the `.ova` suffix when
    assigning its name and target location. For example, the final output should look like `r_u-2204-0-k-1294-0`. This
    naming convention is required for the installation process to identify the OVA. Refer to the
    <PaletteVertexUrlMapper text="Additional Packs" edition={props.edition} palettePath="/downloads/self-hosted-palette/additional-packs/"
    vertexPath="/downloads/palette-vertex/additional-packs/" /> page for a list of additional OS and
    Kubernetes OVAs.

    You can terminate the deployment after the OVA is available in the `spectro-templates` folder. Refer to the
    [Deploy an OVF or OVA Template](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-vm-administration/GUID-AFEDC48B-C96F-4088-9C1F-4F0A30E965DE.html)
    guide for more information about deploying an OVA in vCenter.

    :::warning

    If you encounter an error message during the OVA deployment stating that vCenter is unable to retrieve a manifest or
    certificate, refer to this [known issue](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/79986) from VMware's knowledge base for
    guidance on how to resolve the issue.

    :::

5.  Open a terminal window and SSH into the RHEL airgap VM as a root user with the command below. Replace
    `/path/to/private_key` with the path to your private SSH key, `docs` with the username, and `palette.example.com`
    with the FQDN of the RHEL airgap VM.

    ```shell
    ssh -i /path/to/private_key docs@palette.example.com
    ```

6.  Switch to the `root` user account to complete the remaining steps.

    ```shell
    sudo --login
    ```

7.  Set the VM timezone to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

    ```shell
    timedatectl set-timezone UTC
    ```

8.  Ensure that ports `80` and `443` are not in use by your file server, as these ports will be used by the Harbor
    registry that will be installed later.

    Open the `/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf` file and make the following changes:

    - Replace the line `Listen 443 https` with `Listen 8443 https`.
    - Replace the line `<VirtualHost _default_:443>` with `<VirtualHost _default_:8443>`.

    Save and exit the file.

9.  Next, open the `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` file and replace the line `Listen 80` with `Listen 8080`. Save and exit
    the file.

10. Restart the Apache HTTP server to apply the configuration changes.

    ```shell
    systemctl restart httpd.service
    ```

11. Allow TCP traffic on ports `80`, `8080`, `443`, and `8443`, then reload the firewall.

    ```shell
    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp
    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8080/tcp
    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=443/tcp
    firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8443/tcp
    firewall-cmd --reload
    ```

    The output displays a success message.

    ```text hideClipboard
    success
    ```

12. Set the `AIRGAP_BUILD` variable as `true`. This is required for the RHEL airgap appliance binary.

    ```shell
    export AIRGAP_BUILD=true
    ```

13. Start the RHEL airgap appliance binary, which installs the tools and configures the manifests that are required to
    set up the Harbor registry and push images. Replace `<version>` with the version of the binary received from the support team.

    ```shell
    chmod +x ./airgap-appliance-<version>-rhel-podman.bin && ./airgap-appliance-<version>-rhel-podman.bin
    ```

    Consider the following example for reference.

    ```shell
    chmod +x ./airgap-appliance-v4.4.2-rhel-podman.bin && ./airgap-appliance-v4.4.2-rhel-podman.bin
    ```

14. Reboot your RHEL VM to apply the changes.

    ```shell
    reboot
    ```

    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    Your SSH connection will be terminated. 
    
15. Start a new SSH session and switch to `sudo` mode before proceeding.

    ```shell
    sudo --login
    ```

16. Issue the following command to configure the Harbor registry. Replace `palette.example.com` with the FQDN of the
    RHEL airgap VM. The script will generate a self-signed certificate for the value you provide.

    ```shell
    /bin/airgap-setup.sh palette.example.com
    ```

    The script output should look similar to the example below. It contains the credentials and values you will need when
    completing the installation with the Palette CLI. If you need to review this information in the future, invoke the
    script again.

17. Update the SSL certificate file and key in the **httpd** service.

    :::warning

    You can skip this step if you do not plan to use the local Spectro Cloud Artifact Repository (SCAR) during the
    [{props.edition} installation](#next-steps) process.

    :::

    Open the `/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf` file and add the path to the certificate and key generated in step **15** of
    this guide:

    - Replace the line `SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt` with
      `SSLCertificateFile  /opt/spectro/ssl/server.crt`.
    - Replace the line `SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key` with
      `SSLCertificateKeyFile /opt/spectro/ssl/server.key`.

    Save and exit the file. Next, restart the HTTP server to apply the changes.

    ```shell
    systemctl restart httpd.service
    ```

18. Start the {props.edition} installation binary, which uploads release-specific {props.edition} images and packs to the Harbor registry. Replace `<version>` with the version of the binary received from the support team.

    ```shell
    chmod +x airgap-<version>.bin && ./airgap-<version>.bin
    ```
    
    Consider the following example for reference.

    ```shell
    chmod +x airgap-4-4-14.bin && ./airgap-4-4-14.bin
    ```

    This step may take some time to complete. A `Setup Completed` message confirms it is finished.

    ```

19. Grant the Apache user and group the necessary permissions to serve the files in the `/var/www/html` directory.

    ```shell
    chown -R apache.apache /var/www/html
    ```

    Restart the HTTP server to apply the changes.

    ```shell
    systemctl restart httpd.service
    ```

20. Review the <PaletteVertexUrlMapper edition={props.edition} text="Additional Packs" palettePath="/downloads/self-hosted-palette/additional-packs/" vertexPath="/downloads/palette-vertex/additional-packs/" /> page and identify any additional packs you want
    to add to your registry. You can also add additional packs after the installation is complete.

You have now completed the preparation steps for an airgap installation. Check out the [Validate](#validate) section to
ensure the airgap setup process is completed successfully. After you validate the airgap setup process,
review the [Next Steps](#next-steps).

:::warning

Do not power off the RHEL VM. The RHEL VM is required for {props.edition} to function properly and must
remain available at all times. If for some reason the VM is powered off, power the VM back on and restart
the required services.

Switch to `sudo` mode and restart the file server.

```shell
sudo --login
systemctl restart httpd
```

Next, navigate to the **/opt/spectro/harbor** directory and issue the following command to restart the registry.

```shell
docker compose up --detach
```

:::

## Validate

1.  SSH into the RHEL airgap VM as a root user with the command below. Replace `/path/to/private_key` with the path to
    the private SSH key, `docs` with the username, and `palette.example.com` with the FQDN of the RHEL airgap VM.

    ```shell
    ssh -i /path/to/private_key docs@palette.example.com
    ```

2.  Switch to the `root` user account.

    ```shell
    sudo --login
    ```

3.  Issue the following command to validate that you have successfully completed the airgap setup process. Replace
    `palette.example.com` with the FQDN of the RHEL airgap VM.

    ```shell
    bin/airgap-setup.sh palette.example.com
    ```

    The output must include the registry location and credentials, which must be accessible from within your
    environment.
