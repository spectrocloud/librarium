# Troubleshooting Layout

All Spectro Cloud troubleshooting guides are expected to have the same look and feel. The troubleshooting text and voice must adhere to the Spectro Cloud [style guide](https://github.com/rahulhazra97/Documentation-Guide/wiki/Spectro-Cloud-Style-Guide) for a universal look and feel. The guide must also feel familiar to the reader. Therefore, all troubleshooting guides must follow the layout standard described on this page.
