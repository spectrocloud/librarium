## [How to Layout](https://github.com/spectrocloud/librarium/wiki/How-to-Layout) 

How-to guides help users perform a particular task or set of actions. A well-written how-to guide provides the following benefits:

- Addresses knowledge-sharing issues. 

- Eliminates delays caused by knowledge gaps. 

- Prevents user errors due to clear guidance.

- Reduces time spent searching for task assistance.

The [How-to Layout](https://github.com/spectrocloud/librarium/wiki/How-to-Layout) page teaches you how to structure a how-to guide in accordance with our style and preferred teaching approach.


## [Packs Layout](https://github.com/spectrocloud/librarium/wiki/Packs-Layout)

Before creating your a Pack documentation page, start by reviewing the [Packs Layout](https://github.com/spectrocloud/librarium/wiki/Packs-Layout) page. Documenting Packs can be challenging due to their complex nature, involving multiple components and dependencies. However, this documentation is immensely valuable to our users. Well-documented Packs enable users to understand how to use the pack better, resulting in an improved user experience when consuming the pack.

The [Packs Layout](https://github.com/spectrocloud/librarium/wiki/Packs-Layout) page guides you to structure a pack documentation page to ensure consistency with the rest of our documentation. 




## [Troubleshooting Layout](https://github.com/spectrocloud/librarium/wiki/Troubleshooting-Layout)


A troubleshooting guide is a well-organized collection of guidelines that offer strategies to identify, diagnose, and resolve a wide range of commonly occurring and unpredictable problems. A well-written troubleshooting guide can be an invaluable reference tool. Its purpose is to empower users to independently resolve issues,  and minimize downtime.


Learn how to structure a troubleshooting guide by reviewing the [Troubleshooting Layout](https://github.com/spectrocloud/librarium/wiki/Troubleshooting-Layout) page.

## [Tutorial Layout](https://github.com/spectrocloud/librarium/wiki/Tutorial-Layout) 

A tutorial guides the users through a series of actions or steps. Unlike a how-to guide, a tutorial often provides a starter code and focuses on explaining the why and how.  A tutorial should provide clear instructions and guide the user in learning new skills and completing the milestones established for the tutorial. 

We follow a specific style and teaching approach for all Spectro Cloud tutorials. Review the [Tutorial Layout](https://github.com/spectrocloud/librarium/wiki/Tutorial-Layout) page to learn how to structure a tutorial in accordance with our standards.
