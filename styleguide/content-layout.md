# Content Layout

After you have reviewed the [Spectro Cloud Style Guide](https://github.com/rahulhazra97/Documentation-Guide/wiki/Spectro-Cloud-Style-Guide), the next step is planning and designing your content. 

To create great content, begin with a plan to present the data cohesively. The more we reflexively add information to the documentation, the more the documentation helps users to accomplish their tasks. Ask the Technical Writing team if you have questions when planning, authoring, documentation, or editing. Weâ€™re available on Slack in #docs.  

Build content strategy early. Collaborate with the relevant stakeholders like the PM, design, and marketing partners to develop an outline and preliminary drafts. Identify the content layouts your design needs and solve roadblocks during content strategy planning. 

Research proven layout choices to make your layout decision before developing your content. Try to check which content item fits your design the best. Create opportunities for reader interaction within your content. Adapt content layout elements based on the type of content. 

We welcome all contributions towards docs and education. The following content layout formats will guide you when contributing to the Spectro Cloud documentation:
