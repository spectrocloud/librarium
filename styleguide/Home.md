Welcome to the Spectro Cloud Style Guide.

The [Spectro Cloud Style Guide](https://github.com/spectrocloud/librarium/wiki/Spectro-Cloud-Style-Guide) provides
standards and guidelines for developing Spectro Cloud-related documentation in line with our brand, voice, and style. We
believe in communicating effectively with all users and focus on keeping it simple, concise, and friendly.

To ensure all documentation reflects our voice and style, we recommend you start by reviewing the
[Style Guide](https://github.com/spectrocloud/librarium/wiki/Spectro-Cloud-Style-Guide). Use the
[Spectro Cloud Style Guide](https://github.com/spectrocloud/librarium/wiki/Spectro-Cloud-Style-Guide) to effectively
translate our preferred communication approach into impactful documentation, ensuring that your content resonates with
our audience and encourages interaction.

All of our documentation is expected to follow a set of standard templates. The
[Content Layout](https://github.com/spectrocloud/librarium/wiki/Content-Layout) resource explains each of our writing
artifacts in greater detail.

The following list provides a high-level overview of the writing artifacts we use in our documentation.
