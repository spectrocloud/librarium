            The Spacetastic team decide to look for an external solution that can help them scale and manage their
            Kubernetes services. Partnering with a team of Kubernetes experts allows them to focus on expanding their
            astronomy education platform, instead of spending countless hours migrating and rehosting their services.
            They identify the following list of benefits that their new platform should provide.
