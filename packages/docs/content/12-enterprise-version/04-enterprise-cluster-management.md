# Backup and Restore for Enterprise Clusters

Spectro Cloud provides convenient backup options to backup the Enterprise Kubernetes cluster state into object storage. It restores it at a later point in time if required to the same or a different cluster. Besides backing up Kubernetes native objects like Pods, DaemonSets, Services, etc., snapshot of persistent volumes is taken and maintained as part of the backup. The two options of backup creation are:
* FTP
* S3

FTP mode backup is sending the backup data of your enterprise cluster to a dedicated FTP server using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP).

S3 buckets for backup make it trivial for everyone to use Amazonâ€™s infrastructure for remote backups and secure cluster objects online. In addition, this feature provides the advantages of scheduling, strong encryption, compression, easy access to your backup files. 

## Instructions

  * https://system_IP/system
  * Username: admin
  * Password: custom password
* Select administration from left panel
* On the administration page, select Backup /Restore from the top ribbon
* Complete the Backup configuration wizard to complete the mode of backup creation
* Select the mode of backup from the two available options - FTP and S3
### FTP

* Username and Password to login to the server
* Scheduling details of the backup
	* Interval is specifying the number of days between two consecutive backups
	* Retention period for backup in days
