# On Premise System Requirements

The Spectro Cloud SaaS platform is also available as an entirely customer managed on-prem deployment. The On-Prem version supports the management of kubernetes clusters at customer data centers. Spectro Cloud on-prem is available in two modes:

* Quick Start Mode
* Enterprise Mode

The page will discuss the minimum resource requirements for both these modes of deployment.The deployments uses Ubuntu Operating System and support vSphere version 6.7 and above. Find the common prerequisites of both the versions  as below. 

###  Network Requirements

* The instances should be reachable to Internet either through Proxy or Without Proxy Network Connections.
* Proxy Whitelists
This table lists the proxy requirements for enabling the Spectro Cloud management console.

### vSphere Environment  Prerequisites

* Datacenter
   - IPs for application workload services (e.g.: LoadBalancer services).
   - Subnet with egress access to the internet (direct or via proxy):
   - For proxy: HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY (both required).
   - NTP configured on all ESXi Hosts.
   - VMware vCenter permissions.

* Zone Tagging helps in storage allocation while dynamic storage volume provisioning is in place. Use vSphere tags to label zones in your vSphere environment. The task assumes that your vCenter Server environment includes three clusters, cluster1, cluster2, and cluster3, with the node VMs on all three clusters. In the task, you create two tag categories, k8s-zone and k8s-region. You tag the clusters as three zones, zone-a, zone-b, and zone-c, and mark the data center as a region, region-1.

* VMware vCenter Permissions Required
   The vSphere user account used in the various Spectro Cloud tasks must have the minimum vSphere privileges required to perform the task. The Administrator role provides super-user access to all vSphere objects. For users without the Administrator role, one or more custom roles can be created based on the tasks being performed by the user.

### Optional Settings 
The requirement configurations given below are optional.

* DNS Mapping
   - An URL mapped to internal/external DNS server which can be used to access Spectro Cloud Console.
* SMTP Settings
   - Configure SMTP settings to enable the Spectro Cloud platform to send out email notifications. Email Notifications are sent out to new users when they are on boarded to the platform so they can activate their accounts.Emails regarding Password resets and Alert notifications can also be received with SMTP settings.
* Certificate
   - Provide the desired SSL or TLS server certificates to support external access to valid HTTPs.
* FTP Location (backups)
   - An accessible FTP location to backup data.
   	
# Quick Start Mode

The Spectro Cloud On-Prem Quick Start Mode is a single node installation of the Spectro Cloud platform. This deployment is used to quickly understand the capabilities of the Spectro Cloud platform. For production purposes the enterprise version is recommended. The minimum requirements for Quick Start version is outlined below:

### Hardware Requirements 

Hardware requirements will describe the CPU, memory, and disk requirements for the nodes.
* 8GB memory
* 4 virtual CPUs 
* Secondary storage of 80 GB distributed across multiple HDDs.

### Network Requirements
* The instances should be reachable to the whitelisted domains either through Proxy or Without Proxy Network Connections.
* This instance can be configured with static IP addresses or dynamically allocated IP addresses.

<InfoBox>
 Make sure that your Datacenter CIDR IP address does not overlap Kubernetes PodCIDR range. Kubernetes PodCIDR range settings can be changed while installing On-Prem Quick Start Applications
</InfoBox>

# Enterprise Mode

The Spectro Cloud On-Premise Enterprise version is a highly available multinode infrastructure for production purposes. The minimum number of nodes/VMs required by this environment is 3. Depending on the number of nodes the requirements changes. The minimum requirements are outlined below:

### Hardware Requirements 
Hardware requirements will describe the CPU, memory, and disk requirements for the nodes.
* Each VM requires 8GB memory resulting in 24GB RAM in total .
* 4 vCPUs per node * 3 nodes requiring 12 vCPUs
* Secondary storage of 240GB distributed across multiple HDDs.

### Network Requirements

* A Range or a Subnet of at least 5 static IP addresses is required for the installation and ongoing management. 
* The instances should be reachable to the whitelisted domains either through Proxy or Without Proxy Network Connections.
* For high availability purposes, you may choose to distribute the three VMs across multiple compute clusters.

<InfoBox>
 Make sure that your Datacenter CIDR IP address does not overlap Kubernetes PodCIDR range. Kubernetes PodCIDR range settings can be changed while installing Enterprise version
</InfoBox>


## Private Cloud Gateway Installer

A Private Cloud Gateway is a Spectro Cloud component that enables the communication between Spectro Cloud's management console and a data center which is not accessible directly via the Datacenter hosting Spectro Cloud On-Prem Application. The gateway needs to be installed by the users in their VMware environments using a private cloud gateway installer OVA.
