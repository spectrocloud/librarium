# Spectro Cloud on-premise

Spectro Cloud is also available in an Enterprise version for "on-premise" installations. This version is enabled by downloading a specific OVA from the Spectro Cloud Repository called the *Spectro Cloud Platform Installer*.

The Spectro Cloud Platform Installer allows for:

* the deployment of a Quick Start variant of the Spectro Cloud Management Console.
* the deployment of the Spectro Cloud Enterprise variant.

# Quick Start

Users are welcome to deploy the Quick Start variant until they are ready to deploy the enterprise variant. In this mode, users can use the entire functionality of the product (including the administration settings) without any additional set up. All data from the Quick Start will be preserved and migrated from a backup when the enterprise variant is [deployed](/deploying-the-platform-installer/).

# Enterprise version

The enterprise version provides super admins with two consoles - one for managing the tenants and one for the cluster management. In this mode, full-enterprise level, HA ready clusters can be [deployed](/deploying-an-enterprise-cluster/) and managed.
