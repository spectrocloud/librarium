# On-Premise Installation

The Spectro Cloud SaaS platform is also available as an entirely on-prem and customer managed offering. The on-prem version can be installed in customer datacenters to manage kubernetes clusters. Spectro Cloud on-prem is available in two modes:

## Quick Start

Single node installation of the platform, ideal for PoC environments.

## Enterprise version

Highly available multi-node installation typically for production purposes.



Spectro Cloud provides a platform installer which enables installation of both quick start and enterprise versions. Please [contact us](https://www.spectrocloud.com/contact/) to receive download instructions.
