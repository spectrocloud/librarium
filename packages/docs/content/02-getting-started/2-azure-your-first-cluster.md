# Your First Azure Cluster

* Provision Cluster.

# Cluster Profile

1. Navigate to the Default Project (select back to Default project if you’re in the Admin view).
1. Switch to the *Cluster Profiles* page from the left navigation bar.
1. Click on the *Create Cluster Profile* button.

# Cloud Account

*Cloud Accounts* are where access credentials are stored for public and private clouds. It is used by the system to provide new cluster infrastructure and cluster resources.

<WarningBox>
    <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></p>
    <p>You need your own cloud account with appropriate permissions to create resources like virtual machines, vmnet, subnet, network security groups, route tables etc. Please ensure that your cloud account has at least the following configurations: <a href="/clusters/azure-clusters#prerequisites">Cloud Account Permissions</a>.</p>
    <p>Also, this exercise creates various resources for the cluster infrastructure, so please confirm that your account has sufficient quota for the creation.</p>

# Cluster

For the quick-start guide, we’ll provision a new cluster consisting of a single master and a single worker node:

**Steps:**

1. Navigate to the Default Project (select back to Default project if you’re in the Admin view).
1. Navigate to the *Clusters* page from the left-hand menu.
1. Click on *Create cluster* (and follow the wizard):
    * Name: cluster-azure-1
    * Select Azure cloud from the top environment selection bar. 
    * Select the cluster profile: ExperimentalAzure, click *Next*.
    * Leave the pack parameter overrides as-is, click *Next*.
    * Cloud Properties:
        * Cloud Account: ca-azure-1
        * Subscription: your &lt;Azure Subscription&gt;
        * Region: East US
        * Resource Group: an &lt;Azure Resource availble in Ease US&gt;
        * SSH keys: Create a new ssh key pair (or pick one your existing ones). Enter the public key in this field.
        * Do not select (deselect): Static Placement
        * Click on *Next*.
    * In the node pool configuration:
        * For the *Master* node pool, pick the following properties:
            * Instance type: Standard_B2S (General Purpose)
            * Managed Disk: Standard LRS
            * Managed Disk: 60
        * For the *Worker* node pool, pick the following properties:
            * Instance type: Standard_B2S (General Purpose)
            * Managed Disk: Standard LRS
            * Managed Disk: 60
            * Availability Zones: select  *1*
    * In the final Review step, click on *Deploy*.
1. Wait for the cluster to become Active (check the *Overview* tab). Feel free to click on the Events tab to see the orchestration steps.

Once the cluster is provisioned - feel free to try the following:

* View deployed applications [as described here](/clusters).
* Scale up-down worker nodes [as described here](/clusters/azure-clusters#reconfiguringazurenodes).
* Upgrade Kubernetes to a new version [as described here](/cluster-profiles/task-update-profile).
