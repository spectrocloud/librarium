# What is Spectro Cloud?

Spectro Cloud offers a SaaS product built for customers with significant Kubernetes usage. It offers enterprise grade security whilst making it easy to automate the deployment, maintenance and management of multiple clusters.

Spectro Cloud provides flexibility for organizations to roll and maintain their own Kubernetes infrastructure stacks, whether for distinct organizations or for distinct use cases.

This novel approach helps in reducing costs and increasing efficiency while simultaneously providing a centralized governance. Spectro Cloud works flawlessly irrespective of whether the customer uses a private cloud service provider or a public cloud or a mix of both.

Spectro Cloud has a simple, single, centralized console that allows for administrating clusters on different CSPs. It allows for user management in terms of allowing access to the Spectro Cloud SaaS. For a user that has access to Spectro Cloud, the tenant admin can allow or restrict access to the clusters selectively. Analogous to a real-world scenario, a marketing team member would (generally) not have to be interfacing with a DevOps team member. Similarly, the [teams](/user-management/okta) and [projects](/introduction/concept-overviews#projects) would allow to set such boundaries on Spectro Cloud.
