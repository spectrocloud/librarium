# What is Spectro Cloud?
Spectro Cloud is an enterprise Kubernetes management platform that acts as a single control point for any new or existing Kubernetes clusters in any environment.

## What makes Spectro Cloud different?

### Full-Stack Management
Unlike rigid and prepackaged Kubernetes solutions, Spectro Cloud allows users to construct flexible stacks from OS, Kubernetes, CNI, CSI to additional add-ons. As a result, the entire stack of Kubernetes is deployed, updated and managed as one unit, without split responsibility from virtual machines, base OS, Kubernetes infra, and add-ons. 

### Declarative Lifecycle Management 
Unique declarative profile-based management enables users to institutionalize the knowledge and integrations, drive consistency, repeatability and operational efficiency across multiple clusters in multiple environments, with comprehensive day 0 - day 2 management.

### Any Environment
Spectro Cloud has the richest coverage in supported environments, including public cloud: AWS, Azure, GCP (both IaaS based and cloud’s managed K8s services EKS/AKS/GKE); private cloud/data center: VMware vSphere, OpenStack; Bare metal: Canonical MaaS; Edge.


## What is behind the Spectro Cloud platform?

Spectro Cloud extends CNCF’s open-source Cluster API project and provides comprehensive full-stack modeling and orchestration, governance, security and day0, day1, day2 management capabilities.
