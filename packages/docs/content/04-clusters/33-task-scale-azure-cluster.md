# Scaling an Azure cluster

Scaling a cluster up or down involves changing the size of node pools. The following steps need to be performed to scale up/down an Azure cluster.

* Access the ‘nodes’ view for the cluster
* For the desired node pool, change the size directly from the nodes panel or by editing node pool settings.
* After the node pool configuration is updated, the scale up/down operation is initiated in a few minutes.
* Provisioning status is updated with ongoing progress of the scale operation.
