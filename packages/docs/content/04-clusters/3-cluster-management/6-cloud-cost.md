# Cloud Cost Calculation

## Cloud Cost

Cluster cloud cost is the sum of the estimated cost of all the nodes launched in the cluster. The cost calculation is done based on the instance type and storage type selected for each machine pool.

| |**FORMULAS FOR CALCULATION**|
|--|--------------|
| |Machine Pool Cost = ( Number of Nodes X Instance Price ) + ( Storage Size X Storage Price )|
| |Cluster Cloud Cost = Master Pool Cost + Worker Pool Cost|

**Example 1:**

Let's assume that a cluster ‘demo’ is launched with two machine pools with the following configuration:

|MACHINE POOL|SIZE | INSTANCE TYPE WITH COST|ROOT DISK WITH COST|
|--|-----|---|----|
|MASTER POOL|3|AWS t2.medium($0.0496/hour)|60GB - gp2($0.00014/GB/hour)|
|WORKER POOL|3|AWS t2.large($0.0992/hour)|60GB - gp2($0.00014/GB/hour)|

|Calculation for the above scenario|
|----------|
|master-pool cost = ( 3 X $0.0496 ) + ( 60 X $0.00014 ) = $0.1572/hour|
|worker-pool cost = ( 3 X $0.0992 ) + ( 60 X $0.00014 ) = $0.306/hour|
|Cluster Cloud Cost = $0.1572 + $0.306 = $0.4632/hour|

## Kube Cost
Kube cost is calculated based on the pods' actual CPU & Memory usage and includes the PVC storage size claimed. The pod cost calculation is done by dividing the instance price into CPU and memory proportion of the instance category.


|Instance Type Category| CPU : Memory|
|--|--|
|General Purpose|65:35|
|Compute Optimized|65:35|
|Memory-Optimized|25:75|

|**FORMULAS FOR CALCULATION** ||
|--|--------------|
|Pod CPU Cost = (CPU Proportion x Instance Price ) x Pod CPU Usage|
|Pod Memory Cost = (Memory Proportion x Instance Price) x Pod Memory Usage|
|Pod Storage Cost =  PVC Storage Size x Storage Price|
|Pod Cost = Pod CPU Cost + Pod Memory Cost + Pod Storage Cost|

**Example 2**

For the cluster configuration of master-pool & worker-pool considers in example 1,

|Calculation for the example scenario|
|----------|
|Pod CPU usage = 200m, Pod Memory Usage = 200MB, Pod Storage Size = 10GB|
|Pod CPU Cost = ( 65% * $0.0992 ) * 200m = 0.06448 * 0.2 = $0.012896/hour|
|Pod Memory Cost = ( 35% * $0.0992 ) * 200MB = 0.03472 * 0.2GB = $0.006944/hour|
|Pod Storage Cost =  10GB * $0.00014 = $0.0014/hour|
|Pod Cost = $0.012896 + $0.006944 + $0.0014 = $0.02124/hour|
