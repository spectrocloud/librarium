## Cluster Health Alert

Spectro Cloud defines custom health alerts for our workload clusters. The users can now set up alerts as emails or Webhook alert messages that pop-ups to usersâ€™ chat rooms, any preferred web pages or email. When an alert triggers from the cluster, the Webhook makes an HTTP POST request on the URL. Webhook passes JSON formatted information about the alert in the body of the POST request. To set up an alert, get the hook URL of the target source. E.g., If you want to hook the alerts to your Slack room, Slack's Webhook URL is used. The alert can also be received at any email id preferred by the customer.
