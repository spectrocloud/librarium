# Overview

Spectro Cloud monitors the health of all the workload clusters and raises an alert when the cluster goes to an unhealthy state. Besides displaying the alert on the UI console, Spectro Cloud provides the ability to have these alerts pushed out to a variety of channels. Users can setup simple email alerts to receive an email when health status of their cluster changes. Additionally, they can setup Webhooks to integrate alerts with a variety of ITSM tools such as Service Now, Slack, Microsoft Teams, etc. These alerts are setup at the project level and apply to all clusters within the project.
