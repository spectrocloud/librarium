# Prerequisites - vSphere

Spectro Cloud supports vSphere 6.5 or 6.7 [Update 3](https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere.html)

# Hardware Requirements

[ESXi 6.5 Hardware Requirements](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/com.vmware.vsphere.upgrade.doc/GUID-DEB8086A-306B-4239-BF76-E354679202FC.html)

[ESXi 7.0 Hardware Requirements](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.esxi.upgrade.doc/GUID-DEB8086A-306B-4239-BF76-E354679202FC.html)

# Configuration Requirements

The vSphere environment should be configured with a **DHCP service** in the primary VM Network for your workload Kubernetes clusters. You will also need to configure one resource pool across the hosts onto which the workload clusters will be provisioned. Every host in the resource pool will need access to shared storage, such as VSAN in order to be able to make use of MachineDeployments and high-availability control planes.

# Permissions

The vSphere user account used in the various Spectro Cloud tasks must have the minimum vSphere privileges required to perform the task. The `Administrator` role provides super-user access to all vSphere objects. For users without the`â€˜Administrator` role, one or more custom roles can be created based on the tasks being performed by the user.
