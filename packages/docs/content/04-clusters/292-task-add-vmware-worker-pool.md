# Adding a worker pool

The following steps need to be performed to add a new worker node pool to a cluster:-

* Invoke the option to ‘Add Node Pool’ from the cluster’s node information page
* Provide node pool settings as follows:-
    * A descriptive name for the node pool
    * Number of nodes in the node pool
    * CPU, Memory and Disk settings for all the nodes in the node pool
    * Save the node pool settings. The new worker pool settings are updated and cluster updates begin within a few minutes. Provisioning status is updated with ongoing progress of tasks related to addition of new nodes.
