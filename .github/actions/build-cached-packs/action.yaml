# This configuration file defines a GitHub Action named "Build with cached packs".
# It's a composite action that downloads the latest Pack artifact from the "post_release.yaml" workflow.
# The action is used to retry a failed build that return the exit code 5.
# If the action is invoked, then the latest Pack artifact is downloaded and unpacked in the correct folders.
# The build is then re-run with the downloaded pack data. 
# This is usefull in scenarios the Palette API is experiencing issues or a Pack is breaking the build.
