# This workflow is triggered by the presence of the label 'visual-tests' on a PR.
# The workflow is designed to run visual tests using Playwright on the PR branch by comparing the screenshots with the reference screenshots taken from the default branch.
# The screenshots are compared using the uploaded artifacts generated by the screenshot_capture workflow.
# Upon completion, the workflow generates a visual comparison report that is hosted on GitHub Pages.
# A comment is posted on the PR with the URL to the visual comparison report.
# You can learn more about the visual comparison framework by visiting https://spectrocloud.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DE/pages/2184249350/Visual+Testing
