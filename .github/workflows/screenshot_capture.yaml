name: Screenshot Capture
# This workflow is triggered when a workflow run of the "Release to Production" workflow is completed or when manually triggered.
# The primary purpose of this workflow is to take screenshots of the website using Playwright and upload them as artifacts.
# The screenshots can be used to compare the visual appearance of the website before and after a release.
# The workflow Visual Comparison uses these screenshots to generate a visual comparison report.
