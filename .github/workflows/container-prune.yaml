# This workflow prunes container images based on a retention policy.
# The workflow runs on the completion of the nightly Docker build workflow. 
# Only images that are older than 1 day are pruned. This helps ensure that only the latest images are retained.
# This workflow supports on-demand execution using the workflow_dispatch event.
